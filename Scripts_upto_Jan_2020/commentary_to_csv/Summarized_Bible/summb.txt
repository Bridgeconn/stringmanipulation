Noah's altar. <br><b>Characters</b> - Noah and family. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Rest, v. 4.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Superstition would have worshipped the ark as the means of salvation, but Noah looked to the God back of the means. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When judgment days are past, the believer will find himself safely landed in a better world.

The error in Egypt. <br><b>Characters</b> - Abram, Sarai, Lot, Pharaoh. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sojourners, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - God's biddings are His enablings. Better suffer in Canaan in God's path than live in luxury in Egypt in the devil's path. The altar marks Abraham as a worshipper. The tent marks him as a pilgrim. These are distinguishing marks of the followers of Christ.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The path into which God calls the believer may often be trying to the flesh, but this does not necessarily indicate that he is out of God's will.
Gen 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Abram's return to the land and the altar. Separation from Lot. Lots backsliding and choice of the land.  <br><b>Characters</b> - Abram, Lot. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Separation, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 17, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Lot pictures a professing Christian trying to make the best of both worlds, v. 12.

The first mention in the Bible of the kings, finds them fighting. The last of Revelation leaves them hard at it still.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Genuine- faith never wraps itself in fleece while a brother shivers in the cold. The farther a believer lives from the world, the greater power he will have over it.
Gen 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Abrahamic covenant confirmed and spiritual seed promised. Characters: Abram, God. <br><b>Characters</b> - Abram, God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Seed, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 17. A smoking furnace suggests that the inheritance would be reached by passing through furnaces of trial. The bright lamp tells of God's relief which shines brighter as the road gets darker. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The promises to faith are more certain than the conclusions of logic (v. 25). Faith is the key that unlocks the cabinet of promises. 
Gen 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Birth of Ishmael. <br><b>Characters</b> - Sarah, Abram, Hagar, Angel, Ishmael. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Despised, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - God promises faith believes hope anticipates patience waits.

Gen 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Abraham's lapse at Gerar. Lying to Abimelech about his wife. <br><b>Characters</b> - Abraham, Sarah, Abimelech. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sin, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - One is often struck with the amazing difference between what God's people in Christ are in His view and what they are in the world's view. God sees His own through Christ, although in themselves, they are often feeble and inconsistent.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Sin has many tools but a lie is a handle that fits them all.  If the truth is stretched, expect it eventually to fly back and sting you.

Abraham at Beersheba.<br><b>Characters</b> - Sarah, Abraham, Isaac, Hagar, Ishmael, Abimelech. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Isaac, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - It often involves a struggle to cast the bondwoman and her son out. Gal. 5:1; Col. 3:9. Human religion would keep them in the house.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Behind every promise of God is the purpose and power of God, therefore faith should know that God's bonds are as good as ready money "at the set time."

Characters: God, Abraham, Isaac, angel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Abraham, Isaac, angel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Worship, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 16, 17, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Isaac is a type of Christ "obedient unto death." Abraham illustrates the Father who "spared not His own Son." The resurrection is illustrated in the deliverance of Isaac.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The man of faith must keep his eye on God, looking not at circumstances, nor pondering the results of what God asks of him. The trial of faith is precious.
Gen 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Death of Sarah. Burial in cave of Machpelah. <br><b>Characters</b> - Sarah, Abraham, sons of Heth, Ephron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Burial, v. 4. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - One of the most zealously guarded places in the world is a rectangular building in Palestine, beneath which the cave of Machpelah is supposed to be, and in which are the remains of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. God has never let it come into the hands of those who were disposed to disturb it. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Although the man of faith knows that in the resurrection glory he shall be heir to the land, until that time he will be no debtor to those in temporary possession, (vv. 15, 16.) 
Gen 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Bride of Isaac secured by Abraham's servant. <br><b>Characters</b> - Abraham, servant, Bethuel, Laban, Sarah, Isaac. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Wife, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 27, 40. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Abraham stands for the Father (Matt. 22:2). The servant stands for the Holy Spirit (John 16:13, 14; 1 Cor. 12:7-11). Rebekah stands for the Bride of Christ (Eph. 5:25-32). Isaac stands for the Bridegroom who is coming to receive His Bride (1 Thess. 4:14-16). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God leads in every detail of our lives. The marriage which is not according to His will as shown by His Word and the leading of His Servant, The Holy Spirit, will not -be blessed of Him.

In many respects a nobler man than Jacob, yet the fact that he was destitute of faith caused him to despise his birthright. God's choice of His children does not depend on their character, but their faith. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The natural man values only what he can see and puts no value on the things of God. Many despise their birthright as sons of God because it is a spiritual thing, of value only as there is faith to apprehend it.

Isaac's lapse at Gerar, Isaac as a well digger. <br><b>Characters</b> - Isaac, Rebekah, Abimelech, Ahuzzath, Phichol, Esau, Judith. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Blessed, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 24, 25, 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - There is a great difference between God's blessing through Christ and His presence. One cannot always judge of a believer's spiritual condition by their circumstances, but God has a purpose in all His dealings. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is peculiarly comforting to see that God has ever been dealing with men of like passions as we are and patiently bearing with the same failures. When the believer falls, God is still with him. 
Gen 27:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Fraudulent methods of Jacob in getting Isaac's blessing. Remorse of Esau. <br><b>Characters</b> - Isaac, Esau, Jacob, Rebekah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Supplanter, v. 36. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 28, 29, 33. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - One only needs to read the history of Jacob to learn that it does not pay to take things into one's own hands. The more pressing the temptation to take things out of His hands, the richer will be the blessing of remaining in His hands and awaiting His time. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Human nature in prone to scheme to bring about what God would do without any scheming. He does not need our cunning or deceit to accomplish His purpose. Seek spiritual blessings in the right way or get with them years of sorrow afterward. 
Gen 28:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jacob at Bethel and the Abrahamic covenant confirmed to him in a dream.<br><b>Characters</b> - Isaac, Jacob, Laban, Esau, Ishmael, Mahalath, angels. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Bethel (house of God), v. 19. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 15, 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Bethel, to the Christian, stands for a realization, although often imperfect, of the presence of God through Christ, and the spiritual contents of faith.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer should realize that he is ever in God's presence. However no heart can feel at home in His presence until emptied of self and broken.
Gen 29:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jacob and Laban, two bargain makers, meet. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jacob, Laban, Rachael, Leah, Reuben, Levi, Judah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Beguiled, v. 25. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Jacob at Haran, pictures the nation descended from him at the present time. He was away from the place of blessing, without an altar, but yet under the covenant care of Jehovah and eventually to be brought back.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer who has erred may not be forsaken of God, but he is permitted to reap the shame and sorrow of his self-chosen way. Matt. 7:2.

Another bargain between Jacob and Laban. <br><b>Characters</b> - Rachael, Jacob, Laban, Leah, Joseph. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Blessed, v. 27. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The success of Jacob's policy was not sufficient to justify it, had it been unjust toward the shrewd Laban, but evidently it was not unjust, for see 31:12.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The toiling and scheming of men is the result of ignorance of God's Grace, and inability to put implicit confidence in God's promises.
Gen 31:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jacob's resolution to return. Laban's hot pursuit; their quarrel and final agreement.<br><b>Characters</b> - Laban, Jacob, Rachael, Leah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Plight, v. 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 49. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The settlement of a quarrel is a jewel so precious, one can scarcely buy it too dearly. While the believer may resent injuries, he is not to avenge them but remember that God is the avenger.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The safety of believers under trying circumstances is much due to the hold God has on the consciences of bad men. In the path of obedience, we may count on God's care.
Gen 32:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jacob becomes Israel. Preparation for meeting Esau. Wrestling against the angel. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jacob, Esau, angel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Afraid, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 24, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - To be alone with Christ is the only way to arrive at a knowledge of ourselves and our ways. Jacob was a wrestled-with man, and until the seat of his own strength was touched, he did not reach the place of blessing. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Either we lean on God or on our own plans. The arrangements of unbelief and impatience prevent God acting for us and He must bring us to the end of our own strength. 
Gen 33:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jacob meets Esau. Settles in Canaan. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jacob, Esau, Leah, Rachael, Joseph. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Meeting, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - "Acquaint now thyself with Him and be at peace." Failure in this, causes one, on every fresh occasion, to doubt and hesitate notwithstanding the evidence of God's faithfulness through Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - How groundless are all the Christian's fears and how useless all his self-devised plans. "When a man's ways please the Lord, He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him." 
Gen 34:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Harvest of evil years comes on Jacob and family. Dinah defiled and the bloody revenge.<br><b>Characters</b> - Dinah, Jacob, Hamor, sons of Jacob, Simeon, Levi. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Defiled, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - God had directed Jacob to Bethel. He settled at Shechem. Partial obedience to Christ is responsible for much trouble which befalls Christian families.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Untaught maidens who go out to "gad" with the daughters of the land fall into a snare and involve their relatives in great trouble.
Gen 35:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jacob's return to Bethel and renewed communion. Death of Rachael. Birth of Benjamin. Death of Isaac. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jacob, Deborah, Rebekah, Rachael, Benjamin, Reuben, Bilhah, Isaac, Esau. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Altar, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - "Arise and go to Bethel." God is ever calling the soul back to Himself. Christ says, "Remember from whence thou art fallen and repent and do thy first works."<br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is no perfect communion with God until all idols are put away and we come into His presence as He directs.
Gen 36:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Generations of Esau and their settlements. <br><b>Characters</b> - Esau, Jacob. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Generations, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Edom, a name by which the foolish bargain was perpetuated, means "red pottage." If men sell their birthright in Christ for a mess of pottage, they must thank themselves when afterwards, it is remembered against them to their reproach. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Though one have not a spiritual right by promise, they may still have, in the mercy of God, temporary rights to rich estates in this world. "But what is a man profited if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" 
Gen 37:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Generations of Joseph. Joseph hated and rejected by his brothers. Cast into pit. Carried away by Gentiles.<br><b>Characters</b> - Jacob, Joseph, Reuben, Judah, Potiphar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Envied, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Joseph, a marvelous type of Christ. Rejected because of his testimony to his brethren, sent by the Father on a mission of love, cast into a pit, sold to Gentiles, the Gentiles blessed through him.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Envy is a canker to the soul and hates those excellencies it cannot reach. "Hatred stirreth up strife" and left to itself, only stops at murder.
Gen 38:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Shame of Judah and his sons. <br><b>Characters</b> - Judah, Hirah, Er, Onen, Tamar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Shamed, v. 23. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 26. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - It is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah. Heb. 7:14. Divine grace is seen rising above man's sin to bring about His purpose. The Spirit is conducting us by this chapter, along the line through which, on the flesh side, our Lord came. Man would never have devised such a genealogy.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The sins which dishonor and defile the body are evidences of vile affection and are very displeasing to God, often visited with quick punishment.
Gen 39:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Joseph tested in Egypt in the house of Potiphar. <br><b>Characters</b> - Joseph, Potiphar, Potiphar's wife, prison keeper. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Goodly, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The one taken from the pit, into which he came through rejection, is coming to the place of ruler, the channel of blessing to the Gentiles, sustainer of life to the brethren. (Christ).<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Loyalty to God may bring a believer into serious testings but the almighty grace of God will enable him to overcome the enemy's assaults. Though stripped of possessions, we need not be stripped of virtue.

Interprets dreams. <br><b>Characters</b> - Butler, baker, captain of guard, Joseph, Potiphar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Interpretation, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Bad dreams cannot be given a good interpretation. If a minister of Christ deals faithfully with God's message and it proves unpleasant, it is not his fault.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Whatever our lot in God's providence, we may ever be a blessing to companions in tribulation by showing a concern in their troubles and doing our best, by God's help, to lift their burdens. 
Gen 41:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Pharaoh's dream. Joseph's exaltation in Egypt and his Gentile bride.<br><b>Characters</b> - Pharaoh, Joseph, butler, Asenath, Manasseh, Ephriam. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Exalted (set over), v. 41. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 38, 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - As Joseph solved Pharaoh's vexing problems, so Jesus relieves the heart of its burdens. Rejected, exalted, Jesus is now taking a Gentile Bride to be with Him when the "Time of Jacob's trouble" comes upon the earth.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The faithful believer will be abundantly recompensed for the disgrace he has patiently suffered and his righteousness will shine forth so all will know that God is with him.

Gen 43:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Second visit of Joseph's brethren to Egypt in their necessity. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jacob, Benjamin, Joseph, Simeon, Judah, steward. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Mercy, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14, 23, 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Before Him, who in their blindness they do not know, the Jews will plead for their Benjamin who has been lost to them, and in the agony of the hour, the opened heavens will reveal the Christ they crucified, as their Deliverer. The sufferer and the conqueror are one. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The way to find mercy with men is to seek it of God Who has all hearts in His hand and who works in strange ways for His children, when they know it not. 
Gen 44:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Joseph's brethren further tested. Arrest on charge of taking a cup.<br><b>Characters</b> - Joseph, Judah, Benjamin, steward. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sorrow, v. 31. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16, 33. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - As Joseph laid a plan to bring about full confession from his brethren that they might come into fellowship with him, so Christ will deal with the Jews, culminating in a great day of confession and mourning.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Even in afflictions wherein the believer thinks himself wronged by men, he must own that God has a righteous purpose and possibly it is to make him confess his sin and develope his better nature.
Gen 45:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Joseph reveals himself to his brethren whom he blesses and sends back to Egypt. <br><b>Characters</b> - Joseph, brothers, Pharaoh, Jacob. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Revealed (made known), v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 7, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - A sacred scene is coming for Israel (Ezek. 22:19) when Christ shall be revealed. As they stand self-condemned before Him, He will pour balm into their hearts (Zech. 13:1; 12:9) and will show all to have been decreed for their blessing (Rom. 11:11-12). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - "He worketh all things together for good to them that love God and are called according to His purpose." He can work wonders for His own, when He has surrendered men through whom to work.

His permissive will allows them to settle in Goshen and as far as possible He blesses them there. The Jews sidestepped God's absolute will by rejecting the Messiah, but a day of mingled joy and mourning awaits those living at His second advent. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - A glorious meeting day is coming after the trials and mistakes of earth. Jesus prepares a place for the believer and comes again to receive him unto Himself, that where He is, there they may be also. 
Gen 47:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jacob and descendants exalted in Goshen. <br><b>Characters</b> - Pharaoh, Joseph, brothers, Jacob. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Nourished, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 29, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Christ will, at His second advent, present His brethren, the Jews, in the court of heaven, restoring them to the place of blessing in the earth. As Jacob here blesses King Pharaoh, so Israel's portion in the Millenium will be that of blessing the kings of the earth. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Notwithstanding former unkindnesses received, the believer who is prospered in this world, must not overlook nor despise his poor relatives in their need. The measure of a truly great man is the way he treats men who in themselves have been small. 
Gen 48:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jacob on his death bed blesses Joseph's sons. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jacob, Joseph, Ephriam, Manasseh, Reuben, Simeon, Rachael. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Blessed, v. 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 17. When the tribes were mustered in the wilderness, Ephriam was more numerous than Manasseh (Num. 1:32-35; 2:18-20) and is named first (Psa. 80:2).<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God in His grace, does not always observe the order of nature in bestowing His blessings, nor prefer those whom we think fittest to be preferred, but as it pleases Him, He chooses the weak to confound the mighty, thus His grace becomes more illustrious.
Gen 49:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jacob's dying blessing, prophetic of the tribes of Israel. Characters: Jacob, twelve sons. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jacob, twelve sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prophecy (shall befall), v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The cunning, shifting and often faithless Jacob, the supplanter, bargain maker, comes forth in the calm elevation of faith to bestow blessings and impart dignities. This will be Israel's part in the last great dispensation of earth, after Christ has returned. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is a great blessing to attend upon Godly parents in their last hours that we might learn how to die as well as live, and profit by their reproofs, counsels, and comforts. Though they cannot prophecy, they can tell us from God's Word what will befall us in the last day if we do not do the will of the Father.
Gen 50:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jacob's burial. Joseph's death. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jacob, Joseph, brothers. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Mourning, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 19, 20, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Finding man in a beautiful Eden, Genesis 1, we leave him in chapter 50 in a coffin in Egypt. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - As it is an honor to die lamented, so it is a duty to honor the dead who have been useful in the Lord. Sincere and humble lament over Godly men is proper, for their death is a great loss to any place. 
Exo 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Israel in Egypt and their bondage. <br><b>Characters</b> - Joseph, Pharaoh, Shiprah, Puah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Bondage, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 20, 21.<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - It has been the policy of the persecutors of Israel throughout the centuries to represent them as a dangerous people, hurtful to provinces and untrustworthy, as a pretense for barbarous treatment. God's counsels stand and they still increase. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's providences may at times seem to thwart His promises that His peoples' faith may be tried and His power the more magnified. In their persecutions, He will sustain all who trust Him. 
Exo 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Deliverer prepared for Israel. Moses' birth, boyhood and marriage. <br><b>Characters</b> - Levi's daughter, Pharaoh's daughter, mother of Moses, sister, Moses, Pharaoh, seven daughters of priests, shepherds, Reuel, Zipporah, Gershom. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Moses, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 24, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Moses is a striking type of Christ. Rejected by Israel, he turns to the Gentiles. In his rejection, he takes a Gentile bride, then later appears as Israel's deliverer and is accepted. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When men are plotting the ruin of God's people, God is planning His peoples' salvation. One apparently marked for obscurity and poverty may be destined to rise before the world to show God's power. Even enemies may be used to carry out God's purposes. 
Exo 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Moses called as deliverer. The burning bush. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jethro, Moses, angel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Deliverance, vv. 8, 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 12, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The burning bush pictures Israel in the furnace, yet never consumed. God's relations with Israel are eternal, v. 15. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those qualified for great service may expect for a time to be confined to obscurity for special preparation and the vision of God's purpose. If God gives opportunity and heart to serve Him, it is an ernest of His power to accomplish the work. 
Exo 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Moses' objections. Unbelief of the people and Moses' lack of eloquence. Return to Egypt. Message delivered to elders. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Jethro, Zipporah, elders. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Spokesman, v. 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 12, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The rod, symbol of power in Christ's hand, was not wrenched away from Moses, but cast down by Moses. It remained a serpent only while out of his hand. The rod, temporarily out of Christ's hand, will soon be taken up again and Satan's power will be over.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Unbelief refuses to believe God because it does not find in self a reason for believing. With God, the merest stammerer may prove an efficient minister, neither need he be uneasy as to the reception of the message. 
Exo 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Moses' first contest with Pharaoh. <br><b>Characters</b> - Moses, Aaron, Pharaoh, taskmasters. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Burdens, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Those called to public service for Christ may expect to be tried, not only by the proud threats of enemies, but the unjust, unkind censures of friends who judge by outward appearances.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God, in coming toward His people in mercy may sometimes employ strange methods so that people will think themselves ill-treated. God suffers it to be so that we may learn to cease from man and cease depending on second causes.
Exo 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's answer to Moses' first prayer. Covenant renewed. Families of Israel. Moses' commission renewed. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Pharaoh. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Covenant, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 6, 7, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. Disconsolate spirits often cause us to put from us the comforts we are entitled to in Christ and we stand in our own light. If we indulge in fretfulness, we lose the comfort of His word and must thank ourselves if we go comfortless. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Man's extremity is God's opportunity of helping and saving. God's covenants are as firm as the power and truth of God can make them and we may venture upon all His promises. 
Exo 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Contest with Pharaoh. First plague. Water turned to blood. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Pharaoh, magician. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Smitten (waters), vv. 1, 17.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1,5,17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Satanic resistance to God's testimony of His Son is often offered by those who have "a form of godliness without the power thereof." The magicians finally failed, proving (8:7) their tricks "lying wonders" (Rev. 13:15). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We see God's almighty power, the unstability of all things under the sun and the changes we may meet with in them. What is water today may be blood tomorrow. Sin turns man's comforts into crosses. 
Exo 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Plagues of frogs, lice, flies. Pharaoh's compromising offej*. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Pharaoh, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Smitten, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Pharaoh's compromises are types of those Satan makes with the Christian. "Be a Christian but stay in Egypt, or at least, don't be so narrow as to come out entirely from the world."<br><b>Conclusion</b> - If God be against us, all creatures can be made to be at war with us. God can, as He pleases, arm the smallest parts of creation against men. He may choose contemptible instruments to defeat one, that He might magnify His own power.
Exo 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Plagues of murraine, boils and hail. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Pharaoh, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Smitten, vv. 27, 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. The Lord hardened his heart. Before this, Pharaoh hardened his own heart, resisting God's grace. There is a time when God gives one up to their own reprobate mind. Wilful hardness is sooner or later punished with judicial hardness. If men persist in shutting their eyes, God will close them.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The creature is made subject to vanity by reason of man's sins, liable to serve man's wickedness or share his punishment. When judgments are abroad, they may fall both on righteous and wicked but they are not the same to one as the other in the final reckoning. 
Exo 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Plagues of locusts and darkness. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Pharaoh. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Smitten, v. 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 17, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 11. Godly men make a subtle compromise if they desire for their children, a position in the world, or (v. 24) if they fail to consecrate all their possessions along with themselves to Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's terms of reconciliation are fixed and cannot be disputed or lowered. Men must meet the demand of God's will or God will permit their delusions and answer them according to their sin. 
Exo 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Last plague. Death of firstborn prophesied. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Pharaoh. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Death, vv. 1, 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - In some way, God will always redress the injured, who in humble silence, commit their cause to Him, and in the end, they will not be losers by their adherance to Christ.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Persistent enemies of God and His people will be made to fall under at last and those who have approved themselves, will look great in the eyes of those who have viewed them with contempt.
Exo 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Deliverance for Israel through the Passover. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Pharaoh. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Passover, v. 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 13, 14. 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 8. Secured by the blood, the believer feeds on the Person of the Lamb of God, roast with fire, not raw. If Christ is not seen as the One subjected to the fires of God's wrath against sin, one cannot feed upon Him. He cannot be an example if He is not first an atoning sacrifice. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Deliverance for the believer is based entirely upon the shedding of the blood of a divinely appointed substitute and its application to the heart once for all. If death has taken place for us, it cannot come to us. 
Exo 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Firstborn set apart for Jehovah. Directions for feast of unleavened bread and consecration of males. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Joseph. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Remember, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 16, 21, 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - That which by God's special mercy has in Christ been spared to us should be peculiarly dedicated to God's honor. God who is first and best should have our first and best. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer should retain remembrance of God's great deliverance and to impress it on the heart, should use the appointed means for preserving remembrance. So, under the Gospel, Christ said, "This do in remembrance of me." 
Exo 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - God's power exerted to redeem Israel. Passing the Red Sea. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Pharaoh, angel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Saved, v. 30. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13, 14, 19, 30, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - By the blood, God comes between us and our sins. By His presence, if we will permit, He will come between us and every overcom ing circumstance. The cross separates from sin; the cloud from circum stances.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer cannot go ahead in the strength of Christ until he has learned to stand still in his own helplessness. God can then place Himself between us and our circumstances and wonderfully deliver. 
Exo 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The song of the redeemed. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Miriam. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Triumph, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 6, 7, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Bitter waters (v. 23) in the path of God's leading, remind us of the trials that come to God's people for their edification, not punishment. The tree (cross, Gal. 3:13) cast into the bitter waters, will make them all sweet. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who love God triumph in His triumphs and what is His honor is their joy. Our first thought should be to give glory to God. 
Exo 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Murmuring of the people. Manna and quails given by God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Murmuring, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 7, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Jesus, the Bread of Life (John 6) is the true wilderness bread for believers, ministered by the Spirit through the Word. Christ may be partaken of unreservedly but we have no more of Him than faith appropriates, v. 16. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer is apt to forget a thousand mercies in the presence of one trifling privation. God is longsuffering. Better to be in a desert with God than in the brick kilns of Egypt with Pharaoh. 
Exo 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Smitten rock at Meribah. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Joshua, Aaron, Hur. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah-nissi (The Lord our banner), v. 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Christ is the Rock (1 Cor. 10:4) He was smitten, and resulting from His finished work was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit giving power to all those who believe. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Fed by the Bread of Life; refreshed by the Water of Life (John 7:37) means victory for the believer in every conflict with the world, the flesh and the devil. 
Exo 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Moses joined by his wife and children. Judges selected to solve the problems of the people. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Jethro, Zipporah, Gershom, Eliezer. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Told, v. 8 (testimony). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - It will be noticed (Num. 11:14-17) that God ignored Jethro's counsel and his man-made organization, putting in its place, His own order (v. 18). We are not called to service on the ground of our ability, but Christ's ability. Phil. 4:13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Telling of God's wondrous works is good to the use of edifying What we have the joy of, let God have the praise of, thereby confirming others to faith and encouraging them to real worship. 
Exo 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Israel at Sinai and the preparation for receiving the law. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Ready, vv. 11, 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - (Cp. 1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6; 5:10 with Ex. 19:5). Note that what under law, was conditional, under Grace is freely given in Christ to every believer. Note also that God did not impose law until it was pro posed and accepted by man.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Humble reverence should possess the minds of those who draw near to God for we are sinners in the presence of a holy and righteous Judge; mean creatures before the Mighty Creator.
Exo 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ten commandments delivered to Moses at Sinai. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Commands, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3-17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Law proposes life and righteousness as the end to be attained by keeping it, but proves at the outset that man is in a state of death (Rom. 5:20; 7:7, 13; 3:20). Life and righteousness cannot come by that which only curses, but only through the grace of God in Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - A holy and righteous God has holy and righteous standards. Those who love God will constantly endeavor to live as He requires, enabled by the Holy Spirit. 
Exo 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Laws concerning servants. Injuries to the person. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgments, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - God who gives and maintains life, by His law would protect it. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The great God of heaven stoops to take interest in the detail affairs between man and man and makes regulations even as to the loss of a tooth.
Exo 22:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Judgments on rights of property; crimes against humanity. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgments, 21:1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 29, 30, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - One is struck by the number of things we are told NOT to do. These negative commands reveal human nature to itself. All is changed in the New Testament through Christ's sacrifice.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Man's attitude to his fellow man will be based on his attitude to God and His law.
Exo 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Judgments on the national feasts. Instructions concerning the conquest of Canaan. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgments, 21:1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 12, 20, 22, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Familiarity with idolaters is forbidden (32, 33). The believer by familiar converse with false worshippers, is often drawn into worship with them and his detestation of sin wears off. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's angels will keep the believer in the way, though it lay through the enemy's country and will bring him into the place God has prepared. A precept of obedience goes with every promise. 
Exo 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Order of worship prescribed, pending the building of the tabernacle. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, elders, Joshua, Hur. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Worship, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - We never hear "draw near" (Heb. 10:22) from the shadows of the law. For Christ's work was not then done which entitled the sinner to draw near. Law always says "worship afar off." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The unapproachable glory of God tells a sinner to keep off, but the altar shows him how he can feast and worship in God's presence. 
Exo 25:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Moses in the mount; first directions concerning the tabernacle. Characters: God, Moses. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Pattern, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The tabernacle in every detail foreshadows Christ. Gold is a type of deity; silver of redemption; brass of judgment; blue of heavenly origin; purple of royalty; scarlet of atonement, etc. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The only way for God and man to meet is in the precise way and place which He has appointed (v. 22). When a righteous God and a ruined sinner meet on a bloodsprinkled platform, all is well. (1 Pet. 1:18, 19). 
Exo 26:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Further directions regarding the tabernacle. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fashion (pattern), v. 30. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - We as Christ's followers have here no continuing city, being strangers and pilgrims through this world to a better land, having a moveable tabernacle. The presence of God is not tied to any place. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The wonders of God's presence are known only to those, who by the proper ceremonies, have come inside the curtains of His grace. The natural man is screened out from the things of the Spirit. 
Exo 27:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Directions about the brazen altar and the court. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Pattern, 25:9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - In Jesus, God comes down in grace to the sinner. In Jesus the sinner is brought up in righteousness to God. These are our only grounds of standing before God.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Sinful man dare not approach God (at the ark) Heb. 9:8; but God approaches man as a sinner through Christ (brazen altar). There were blood prints all the way from the ark to the altar. Redeemed on that path, the sinner is safe in the courts of God. 
Exo 28:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Directions about the priesthood. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Eleazar, Ithmar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Ministry, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 29, 41. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Every true believer, through identification with Christ, is an earthly priest of God's family (Rev. 1:8) properly clothed for the work, (Rev. 19:7, 8), and should be duly consecrated and sanctified for his work of testimony.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer need never fear God has forgotten him for the Great High Priest bears the names of His own on His breast before God, presenting them as "those accepted in the beloved."
Exo 29:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Consecration of the priests and the offerings. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Aaron's sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Consecration, v. 26. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 18, 45, 46. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Consecration means "to fill the hand." It is not the believer filling God's hand. In the arms of Aaron's sons were put the parts of the sacrifice which speak of the inherent richness and power of Christ. This was their acknowledgment that the power for service was not in themselves, but in another. This is consecration. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those representing God should be set apart in solemn consecration. All their service must be based on the ground of the burnt offering. 
Exo 30:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The altar of incense and the brazen laver. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Incense (worship), v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Fire under the incense altar brought out the fragrance (Rom. 8: 26, 27). The fire was from the blood-sprinkled altar (Heb. 10: 19, 20). Their prayers were based on the intercession of a priest (Rom. 8:34).<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The prayer of a contrite believer ascends as a fragrant cloud to God. (Prov. 15:8). 
Exo 31:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The tabernacle and its workmen. Sabbath made a sign between God and Israel.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Bezaleel, Aholiab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Workmanship, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - When Christ sent His apostles to rear the Gospel tabernacle He poured out His Holy Spirit upon them to enable them to speak with power the wonderful works of God.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - When God gives a commission, He will, in some measure give the qualifications according as the service is. When God has work to be done, He will not be without instruments.
Exo 32:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The broken law; Israel worships a golden calf. Intercession of Moses. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Great Sin, v. 30. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 26, 29, 32. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Moses typified Christ, who went above (Acts 1:9) telling the people to tarry. In His absence, some forget his promised return (John. 14:3; Acts 1:11) and make themselves gods (2 Tim. 3:1-4; 4:3-4; Matt. 24:12) denying His return (2 Pet. 3:3-4; Matt. 24:48, 49). Jesus will come unexpectedly (Matt. 25:13) punishing evil doers (2 Thess. 2:7, 8) who are naked (Rev. 6:16, 17) and gathering the true to Himself (1 Thess. 4:13-18). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is a great sin to make gold, or anything else, a god, as those do who let it become a supreme object of their affections, taking the place of God in any degree. 
Exo 33:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The journey to be resumed. God's presence assured. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Presence, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11,14,20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Moses, as a prince who had power with God, was a type of Christ the great Intercessor whom the Father heareth always. Through His intercession, we obtain constant assurance of the blessings of salvation. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's special presence with us in the wilderness by His Spirit and grace to direct, defend and comfort, is the surest pledge of His acceptance of us. The bitter fruit of sin in the believer is the lost sense of His presence, which will cause any true believer to lament. 
Exo 34:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Second tables of the law. The new vision and commission. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Tables of testimony, v. 29. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7, 14, 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The shining of Moses' face was a great honor to him but nothing compared to the glory which excelled. We read of Jesus, that not only His face shone, but His whole body and His raiment was glistening rLuke 9:29). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - (12-17). We cannot expect the benefit of God's promises unless we make conscience of His precepts. God's name is "Jealous" and we cannot worship Him aright if we do not worship Him alone. 
Exo 35:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - People instructed as to the tabernacle. The gifts of the people for the work.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Bezaleel, Aholiab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Gifts, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 21, 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - If we cannot do what others do for God, we are not to sit still and no nothing. Though our offering gains us no reputation with men, if given according to ability, it does not fail of acceptance with Him. (2 Cor. 8:12).<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God loves a cheerful giver and is best pleased with a free-will offering. Our gifts are our acknowledgment that we receive all from Him and dedicate all to Him.
Exo 36:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The tabernacle work begun. The curtains, coverings, sockets, bars, vail.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Bezaleel, Aholiab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Work, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 5, 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Precious souls redeemed by Christ are the material of the Gospel tabernacle. (1 Pet. 2:5). Those called to the building of this house are those whom God has in some measure made fit for the work. Ability and willingness are the two things to be regarded in the call of the Christian worker.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The talents with which God has entrusted the believer are not to be laid up but laid out. Have your tools ready and God will find you work.
Exo 37:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Making of the ark, mercy seat, table, candlestick, altar. <br><b>Characters</b> - Bezaleel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Work, 36:1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Jesus Christ, the great propitiation, has made reconciliation for the believer, restoring communion with God. From the mercy seat, He accepts us and teaches us, and under the shadow of the Spirit we are safe. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - As the workmen were to take great care to make all according to God's pattern, so the believer should have respect to all the light God gives, even to every iota and tittle of His commandments. God delights in sincere obedience and keeps exact account of it. 
Exo 38:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Altar of burnt offering, laver, court, gate. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Bezaleel, Aholiab, Ithamar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Work, v. 1. 36:1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - On the altar of burnt offering all the sacrifices were made. The altar is a type of Calvary's cross on which Christ, our whole burnt offering, offered Himself without spot to God (Heb. 9:14). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - As the workmen were to take great care to make all according to God's pattern, so the believer should have respect to all the light God gives, even to every iota and tittle of His commandments. God delights in sincere obedience and keeps exact account of it. 
Exo 39:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Garments for Aaron. Characters: God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Garments, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 42, 43. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Christ, our High Priest, in undertaking the work of man's restoration, wore the clothes of service the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, which He had without measure.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - All believers are spiritual priests and their service-clothes are provided (Rev. 19:8). All who converse with them should be able to see that they are properly clothed as God's representatives.
Exo 40:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Tabernacle set up. God's glory manifested. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Finished, v. 33. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 34, 38. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - What the glory cloud was to the tabernacle, the Holy Spirit is to the Church and the temple, which is the believer's body. (1 Cor. 6:19).<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God will dwell with those who prepare Him a habitation. Where God has a throne and an altar in the heart, there is a living temple in which the Spirit will be manifested.
Lev 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The burnt offering laws. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron's sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Burnt sacrifice, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The burnt offering stands for Christ who offered Himself without spot to God in delight to do the Father's will even unto death. Fire, symbol of God's holiness, consumes the offering. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Utter dependence upon the sacrifices, typifying the great sacrifice of Christ on which the iniquity of us all was laid is God's requirement. (The laying on of the offerer's hands signified identification of the believer with his offering). 
Lev 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Meat offering and first-fruits laws. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron's sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fine flour offering, v. 1. First-fruits, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Fine flour speaks of the balance of the character of Christ; fire of His testing by suffering; frankincense of the fragrance of His life to God; absence of leaven, His character as "The Truth;" absence of honey His life was not mere natural sweetness which may exist apart from God; oil mingled, Christ as born of the Spirit; oil upon, Christ baptized with the Spirit. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Leaven, typifying malice, wickedness and human pride is not accepted in spiritual sacrifices. Take heed of those sins which will certainly spoil the acceptableness of worship. 
Lev 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Peace offering laws. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron's sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Peace offering, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Details of the peace offering bring out the thought of fellowship, hence the peace offering is set forth as affording food for the priests, (7:31-34). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In Christ, God and the sinner meet in peace. God is propitiated and the sinner reconciled; both alike satisfied with Christ's work. "He is our peace." 
Lev 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sin offering laws.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sin offering, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The sin offering is Christ seen laden with the believer's sins, absolutely in the sinner's place and stead, and not as in the sweet savor offerings, in His own perfections. Read Isa. 53. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Even sins done in ignorance need to be atoned for by sacrifice. To plead ignorance when charged with sin will not deliver. Our only hope is in acceptance of Him who "became sin for us."
Lev 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Trespass offering laws. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Trespass offering, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The chapter teaches us that we all have need to pray with David, "Cleanse thou me from secret faults." Psa. 19:12. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Even when a man unwittingly breaks the laws of God, full restitution must be made, which is possible only through the presentation of the sacrifice. 
Lev 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Further directions about offerings. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron and sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Offerings. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Trespass against our neighbor is trespass against God, because it is an affront to our Saviour who has redeemed us and the injury reflects upon God who has commanded that we should love our neighbor as ourselves. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Since Christ has "made His soul an offering for sin" we should seek to make restitution to any person we have injured or defrauded, and until we do, we will not enjoy the comfort of His forgiveness of our sins. 
Lev 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Further directions concerning offerings. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron and sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Offerings, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 37,38. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Use of leaven, v. 13, is significant. In v. 12, as the believer thanks God for his peace, he first of all presents Christ, Eph. 2:13, so leaven is excluded. In v. 13, he gives thanks for his participation in the peace, and the leaven signifies, that although having peace through Christ, the believer in himself is not perfect. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We are not left to our liberty in the solemn acts of religious worship, but are under obligation to perform them in the manner God directs in His Word. 
Lev 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Consecration of Aaron and sons for the priesthood. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron and sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sanctification, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13,36. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Priests did not consecrate themselves. Moses was the appointed instrument of God to do this work. The sons of Aaron simply presented themselves for the work. See Rom. 12:1, where the believer presents himself unreservedly to Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All who minister about holy things must have an eye to God's commands as their rule and warrant, for only in the observance of these may they expect to be owned of God in their service. 
Lev 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Priests begin their ministry before the Lord. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron and sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Offering presented, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 23, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - God does not ordain priests to be idle. Without a days respite after their consecration, Aaron and his sons were immediately employed. God's spiritual priests have work laid out for them by Christ.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God draws nigh to those who draw nigh to Him in the appointed way the offering of faith in His Son, the Great Sacrifice being acceptable to Him. 
Lev 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Strange fire of Nadab and Abihu. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazer, Moses, Aaron, Ithamar, Michael, Elzaphan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Strange fire, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Strange fire typifies any use of carnal means to kindle the fires of devotion and praise, which, if true, come only from Christ and the Holy Spirit.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is fatal to act in the things of God without seeking the mind of God (will worship, Col. 2:23.)
Lev 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The proper food for God's people defined. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Eating, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 45. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - God's covenant people, Israel, by having a diet peculiar to themselves would be kept from familiar conversation with idolatrous neighbors. The laws, however, were probably primarily sanitary and necessary to the good of the people.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The body is the Lord's and it is sin against God to prejudice health for the pleasing of appetite.
Lev 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The law of motherhood. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Conceiving, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Our Lord, though not conceived in sin his mother accomplished the days of purification (Luke 2:22-24) and so poor were His parents that they could not bring a lamb. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All are conceived and born in sin (Psa. 51:5) for, if the root be impure, so is the branch. It is only by Christ, the great sin offering, that the corruption of the child nature is done away. 
Lev 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Laws concerning those afflicted with leprosy. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Leprosy, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 45, 46. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Leprosy is a figure of the moral pollution of men's minds by sin, which is the leprosy of the soul, curable only through Christ's atoning work.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Man is beset with troops of diseases on every side and all entered by sin. If not afflicted with any of these terrible sores, we are bound to praise God and glorify Him the more with our bodies.
Lev 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Laws concerning cleansing of lepers. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Cleansing, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The leper did nothing toward his own cleansing. He was sought out by the priest and cleansed by him. Our cleansing is by Christ alone.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - As the leper was cleansed from his fearful malady through the water and the blood, so Christ comes into the soul for its cleansing "by water and blood" (1 John 5:6). See John 19:34.
Lev 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Imperative personal cleanliness. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Unclean, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 30, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The chapter speaks to us of the contagion of sin and the danger of being polluted by conversing with those who are polluted. "Save yourselves from this untoward generation." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Unclean diseases of the flesh are a wound and dishonor, the consumption of the body, and a sin which is often its own punishment more than any other. 
Lev 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Day of atonement laws. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Atonement, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 30, 34. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - As the priest entered the holiest with the blood, so Christ entered heaven itself with His own blood for us (Heb. 9:11, 12). His blood makes the throne of God a mercy seat which otherwise must have been a throne of judgment. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - "Without the shedding of blood there is no remission for sin." 
Lev 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The place of sacrifice and the sanctity of the blood. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Blood, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The worship of Christians is not now confined to one place (John 4:21; 1 Tim. 2:8) yet Christ is our altar and through Him, God dwells among us by His Spirit. It is in Him that our sacrifices are acceptable to God. 1 Pet. 2:5. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's people all meet at one altar in His appointed way, thereby preserving unity and family love among themselves. 
Lev 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Relationship and walk of God's people. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Abominations, v. 26. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 5, 24, 26, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - There are many sins which level men with the beasts but these here mentioned sink men lower than beasts.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Fleshly lusts war against the soul and will certainly be the ruin of it, if God's mercy and grace prevent not.
Lev 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Further laws concerning proper relationships. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Holy, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 12, 18, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Notice the caution against having anything to do with spiritism. Seek not to them for discovery or advice and regard not their offers. It is an abomination to God. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's people being distinguished from all other people by a peculiar relationship with Him through Christ, should teach them real separation from the things of the world and flesh and entire devotedness to the will of God. 
Lev 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Further laws on relationship and walk of God's people. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Separated, v. 24. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 8, 22, 23, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Observe again the plain warning against spiritism. What greater madness than to go to an enemy for advice. Spiritualism is spiritual adultery, giving honor to the devil which is due to God.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God has distinguished His people from all others by a holy covenant with them through Christ, therefore they should distinguish themselves by consistent and holy living.
Lev 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Relationship and walk of the priests. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron and sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Holy, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - We must honor those whom God has called as His ministers and every Christian should consider himself as concerned to be the guardians of their honor. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those whose office it is to instruct in God's truth must do it by example as well as precept. 
Lev 22:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Separation of the priests; perfection of the sacrifices. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron and sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Separate, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 31, 32. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 19 a law to make sacrifices fitter to be types of Christ, the great Sacrifice from which all these derive their virtue. He is called a "lamb without spot and without blemish" (1 Pet. 1:19). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those contract great guilt who profane sacred things, doing in their own uncleanness, service which pretends to be hallowed to Him. 
Lev 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The feasts of Jehovah. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Feasts, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - As given to Israel, there were seven great religious festivals. Passover, feast of unleavened bread, feast of first-fruits, feast of Pentecost, feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, feast of Tabernacles, all typical of Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Sabbaths of the Lord in our dwellings will be their beauty, strength and safety (by rising on the first day of the week and meeting His disciples again and again on that day, Christ appointed that day a holy convocation). 
Lev 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Penalty of blasphemy. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, son of Israelitish woman. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Blasphemy, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. Those who sit in judgment should sincerely desire, and by prayer to Christ for wisdom, should endeavor to know, the mind of the Lord.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - If those who profane the name of God escape punishment from men, yet the Lord our God will not suffer them to escape His righteous judgments.
Lev 25:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Laws of the land. Sabbatic year and year of Jubilee. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sabbatic year, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 18,19,35,36,37. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 25, the kinsman redeemer is an illustration of Christ who assumed our nature that He might be our kinsman, redeeming our inheritance which we by sin had forfeited. He made a settlement for all who become allied with Him by faith.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The blessing of God upon our provision will make a little go a long way and satisfy even the poor with bread. We can lose nothing by faith in God's promises and self-denial in our obedience.
Lev 26:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Conditions of blessing and warnings of chastisement.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Punishment, v. 24. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9, 40, 41, 42. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - If God's people faithfully observe His statutes they are assured that His hand (vv. 7, 8) will so signally appear with them that no disproportion of numbers could make against them. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All adverse circumstances that come upon a people are God's servants, used often as a scourge wherewith He chastises a provoking people. If less judgments will not do their work, God will send greater, for when He judges a nation He will overcome. 
Lev 27:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Laws concerning dedicated persons and things. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vows, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Let us not think because we are not tied to ceremonial laws that we are free of religious obligations. "Having boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith" saying "Blessed be God for the gift of His Son." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We should be cautious in making vows and constant in keeping those we have made. What is once devoted to the Lord should be His forever by a perpetual covenant. 
Num 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Moses commanded to take census. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Numbered, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 54<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - None under 20 years old were listed for military service. In compassion for their tender years God would not have them to bear arms. Nor were any to be numbered who were through any bodily infirmity, rendered unfit for war. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Lord knows all those that are His (2 Tim. 2:19) by name (Phil. 4:3) and even the hairs of their heads are numbered. To all others He will say "I never knew you." 
Num 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Order of the host and arrangement of the camp. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Camp, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 34. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The chapter furnishes an illustration of the movable state of Christ's people in the world, "strangers and pilgrims." At the same time it is a military state our life is a warfare, as "good soldiers of Jesus Christ." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God is a God of order and not confusion, thus the camp of the saints should be compact, everyone knowing and keeping his God appointed place. 
Num 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Order of the host; placing of the Levites. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Levites, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The Church is called "the church of the firstborn" which is redeemed not as the firstborn of the Israelites, with silver and gold, but ransomed with the precious blood of Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Having gifts differing according to the Grace given us if ministry, let us wait on our ministering (Rom. 12:7). God has a place of definite service for each of His children. 
Num 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The service of the Kohathrites, Gershonites and Merarites. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Service, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 49. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. They were not employed until 30 years old. This is not obligatory on Gospel ministers, but gives us a suggestion that ministers should not be novices but should be men of steadiness, and ripeness of judgment, knowing Christ well. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is a service appointed to each of God's people in connection with His Church, and no matter how obscure the place it is important in God's program. 
Num 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Defilement of the camp. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Defilement, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - All wives should learn from the "jealousy offering" to guard against giving any occasion for suspicions of their chastity to abstain from all appearance of evil. Husbands should learn not to entertain causeless or unjust suspicions of their wives. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The purity of the church must be as carefully guarded as the order of it and it is for the edification of it that those who are openly and incorrigibly vicious should be cut off from communion until they repent. 
Num 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The Nazarite laws. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Separation, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 24,25,26. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The Nazarite type found a perfect fulfillment in Jesus who was "holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners" (Heb. 7:26) and allowed no mere natural claims to divert Him.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Christian should be a true Nazarite, fully consecrated to God and separated from the things of this world, thus securing the special blessing of God.
Num 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The gifts of the princes. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, princes. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Offering, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 89. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Observe that the offerings of the princes were identical yet each is separately recorded by the pen of inspiration, showing how God takes notice of every whole-hearted gift. Mark 12:41-44.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The great men should with their wealth and power uphold the work of God and should make conscience of being devout because of their great influence.
Num 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Cleansing of the Levites for the ministry of the tabernacle. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Cleanse, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 21, 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - It is a great kindness to the Church that God has appointed overseers to go before the people in the things of God and religious worship. When Christ ascended, He supplied the gifts for His work (Eph. 4:8-12). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All Christians, and especially ministers, should cleanse themselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord. Those who bear the vessels of the Lord must be clean. 
Num 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Law of the Passover; the guiding cloud. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Passover, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - As it was safe and pleasant going for Israel when led by the cloud, token of God's presence, so there is peace for the Christian who has set Christ, the Great Shepherd, before him.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who by circumstances are compelled to absent themselves from God's ordinances, may expect the favor of God's grace under their afflictions, and those who of choice absent themselves may justly expect the tokens of God's displeasure.
Num 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The first march of the camp. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron's sons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Journeying, v. 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 33, 34. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Those who through Christ, are bound for the heavenly Canaan should invite and encourage their friends to go along with them.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who have given themselves up to the leading of God's Word and Spirit, steer a safe course and so long as they walk in fellowship with their Guide, they need not fear losing the way.
Num 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Complaints about the manna and the consequences. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Eldad, Medad, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Complaining, v. 1. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Unconverted church members with no healthy appetite for the Bread of God, the things of Christ, will clamor for things pleasing to the flesh in the work and way of the church.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Though God graciously gives us leave to complain to Him when there is cause, yet He is justly provoked if we are fretful when there is no cause and especially when we have been surrounded with His special favors.
Num 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Murmuring of Miriam and Aaron and the consequences. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Miriam. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Criticism, (speaking against), v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - There are seasons when it is decidedly out of place to criticize the leaders of the people. This affront was ill-natured and ill-timed, when the people were disposed to mutiny and had given Moses much vexation with their murmurings. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We have reason to be exceedingly cautious of saying or doing anything against the servants of God, for God will plead their cause if they are true servants and will reckon with the critic. 
Num 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Spies sent into Kadesh-barnea, and their report. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Caleb, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Searching, v. 25. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 27, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Many Christians are forever getting frightened at these tremendous giants in the land who make them feel like grasshoppers. Giants cannot stand in the way of Christ's work if His people will be valiant in His strength. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Faith looks at difficulties through God but unbelief looks through difficulties at God. All things are possible, if but promised, to him who believes. 
Num 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Murmuring over the spies' reports and the consequences. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Caleb, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Murmured, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 13-19. The best pleas in prayer are those taken from Christ's honor. The more danger there is of others reproaching Christ's power, the more desirous we should be to see it glorified.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - All the dangers that we are in are from our own distrust. We would succeed against all enemies if we did not make God our enemy. We are excluded from God's blessing only by excluding ourselves.
Num 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Burnt and free will offerings. Characters: God, Moses, man who broke Sabbath. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, man who broke Sabbath. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Offerings, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 35. God is jealous for the honor of His Sabbaths and will not hold men guiltless who profane them. God gave this exemplary punishment as a standing warning against presumptuous disregard of His holy day. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Sins committed ignorantly must have atonement made for them, for although God is very merciful with the ignorant, their ignorance cannot justify them. The presumptuous sinner invites severe judgments. 
Num 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The gainsaying of Korah. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Korah, Dathan, Abriam. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Murmur, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 26, 48. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Men who have been true to Christ need not fear being slurred by others. Men who are most serviceable are often abused most shamefully. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Proud and ambitious men projecting their own advancement by thrusting themselves into a place to which God has not appointed them, hurry on to a shameful fall. 
Num 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Aaron's rod that budded. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Chosen, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The budding rod is a type of Christ, who in His resurrection was owned of God as High Priest. All other authors of religion have died. Christ alone is exalted as High Priest.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Fruitfulness is the best evidence of a divine call. The plants of God's setting will nourish.
Num 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Regulations concerning maintenance of the priests. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Given, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 12, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - God orders that Christ's ministers should be well recompensed that they might be the more entirely addicted to their ministry and not be disturbed in it by worldly care.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - We are to value as a great gift of divine bounty those called to be serviceable to us in the work of the church.
Num 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The ordinance of the red heifer. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Aaron, Eleazer. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Unclean, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Water typifies the Spirit and the Word. The Spirit uses the Word to convict the believer of some sin allowed. Thus convicted, he remembers that the guilt of his sin has been met by the sacrifice of Christ, therefore instead of dispairing, he judges and confesses the sin and is forgiven and cleansed. (1 John 1). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer needs constant cleansing from defilement contracted in his pilgrim walk through the world.

God has infallible foresight of all the wickedness of the wicked. How often He has conferred His favors upon those whom He knew would deal treacherously and ungratefully. "How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out."<br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is a great encouragement to God's people that in the place of some useful instrument of His whom He removes, He raises up others to carry on His work.
Deu 32:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The song and exhortation of Moses. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Doctrine, v. 2. (He gave a song of praise, Ex. 15, but this is one of instruction) .<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 29, 43. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 49, 52. Those may die happily whenever God calls them, who have had a believing prospect through Christ and a foregleam of the heavenly Canaan as a well grounded hope of life beyond death.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The warning and consoling words of God sent down from heaven should sink into our hearts and soften them as the rain softens the earth, so make us fruitful in obedience.

Deu 34:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision and death of Moses. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Death, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - It was reserved for Joshua (the Lord Jesus of whom Joshua was a striking type) to do for us that which the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh. Through Him we are led into the land of rest the rest of conscience and the rest of heaven. We leave Moses, the great law giver, buried in the plains of Moab. We leave our Saviour, who came to fulfill the law, and bear for us its curse, seated at the right hand of God on high, awaiting the hour of His return, when of the increase and peace of His government, there shall be no end.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those may leave this world with cheerfulness who have known God face to face through His Son, and who have had the vision of the heavenly Canaan in their eye. 
Jos 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Joshua's commission and command. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Strong, vv. 6, 7, 9, 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Joshua, type of Christ as Captain of our Salvation. 2:10, 11. He comes after Moses, John 1:17. 8:37. Our Advocate when we have met defeat, portions, Eph. 1:11, 14.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who make the Word of God their rule and conscientiously walk by that rule will both do well and make great progress. We will be animated and emboldened for God's work as we keep our eyes upon the divine warrant.
Jos 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Rahab and the Jericho spies. <br><b>Characters</b> - Joshua, two spies, Rahab, king of Jericho. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Spies, v. 1.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 18, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 21. Rahab's scarlet line speaks, by its color, of the safety that comes to our households through the sacrifice of Christ if it be exhibited by faith in the believer. Heb. 9:19, 22.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let not God's people be afraid of their most powerful enemies, for their God can, when He pleases make their worst enemies afraid of them.
Jos 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The passing of Jordan. Characters: God, Joshua, priests. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, priests. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Passover, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The passing of the Jordan is a type of the believer's death with Christ (Rom. 6:6-11; Eph. 2:5, 6; Col. 3:1-3) in which we pass from an old world into a newness of life.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer is to go on in the way of duty, though foreseeing great difficulties, depending on the divine sufficiency for that which he finds himself not sufficient for. "Is anything too hard for Jehovah?"
Jos 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The memorial stone. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, priests, 12 men. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Memorial, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The Lord Jesus, our Joshua, passed through the Jordan of death, opening the Kingdom to all believers. He appointed his twelve apostles according to the tribes of Israel by the memorial of the Gospel to transmit the knowledge of this to the remote places and to the future.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's works of wonder on our behalf ought to be kept in everlasting memory and means devised for preserving our memory of them. Key Word: Memorial, v. 7. 
Jos 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Reproach of Egypt rolled away. New food for the new place. The unseen captain. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Reproach (rolled away), 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The N. T. uncircumcision is world conformity, the failure openly to take a believer's place with Christ in death and resurrection. Gal. 6:14-16; Rom. 6:2-11. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - (Circumcision, the seal of the covenant in their flesh, was neglected in the wilderness wanderings. They were hereby owned as freeborn children of God, the reproach of the bondage in Egypt being removed.) God is jealous for the honor of His people and is ready to roll away  whatever reproach they may for a time lie under, if they become "circumcised in heart." 
Jos 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Conquest of Jericho. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, priests, Rahab, 2 spies. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fall (of Jericho), v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - By the foolishness of preaching, fitly compared to the sounding of the ram's horns, the devil's kingdom is thrown down and the weapons of our warfare, though not carnal, nor seeming to a carnal eye able to accomplish anything, are yet mighty, through God, to the pulling down of strongholds. 2 Cor. 10:4, 5. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The victories of faith are often to be won by means, and upon principles utterly foolish and inadequate in the view of human wisdom. If faith is obedient to God's precepts, He will certainly confound the mighty with the weak things. 
Jos 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sin of Achan and the defeat at Ai. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, Achan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Accursed, v. 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 13, 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The story illustrates the truth of the oneness of the church in Christ. 1 Cor. 5:1-7; 12:12, 14, 26. The whole cause of Christ is injured by the unspirituality of one believer.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let all men know that it is nothing but sin that separates them from God and if it be not sincerely repented of and put away, will bring disaster, not only upon themselves, but those associated with them. 
Jos 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Conquest of Ai. The blessings and cursing of Ebal. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, king of Ai. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Victory (took the city), v. 19. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 26, 35. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Achan, caught with forbidden spoil, lost it, his life and all. The people who had conscientiously refrained from the accursed Thing were given the spoil of Ai. The way to have the comfort of what God allows us through Christ is to forbear what He forbids us. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer, clad in the whole armor of God, meeting the enemy of God as God directs, will see the scale easily and quickly turned against those who have not God on their side. 
Jos 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The league with the Gibeonites. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, ambassadors of the Gibeonites. <br><b>Key Word</b> - League, v. 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 4, 5, 12, 13. God's people have often been deceived and imposed upon with a show of antiquity. Those who will be caught with the Gibeonitish strategem prove that they have not consulted God. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We make more haste than good progress in any business when we do not stop to take God along with us and by the Word and prayer to ascertain His will. 
Jos 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Victory at Gibeon, Makkedah, etc. Sun's action halted. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, Adonizedek, king of Makkedah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Delivered, vv. 8, 30, 32. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 14, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 25. A figure of Christ's victories over the powers of darkness and the believer's victories through Him. All enemies shall be made His footstool. Psa. 110:1. All things will be put under Him, Heb. 2:8, and principalities and powers made a show of. Col. 2:15. v. 12. Astronomy demands this day and histories of several countries declare it took place. Astronomical calculations have shown a period of 23 1/3 hours to be accounted for somewhere in this period of time, v. 13. (About a whole day). See 2 Kings 20:11 ten degrees, 40 minutes, the exact balance wanted to make up another 24 hours. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When enemies set themselves in array against us and threaten to swallow us up, we may by faith and prayer, apply to Christ, our Joshua, for strength and succor and will assuredly receive the answer of victory and faith. 
Jos 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Final conquest of Canaan. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, Jabin, Jobab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Delivered, vv. 6, 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - As Israel, at first forwarded by miracles, and now left to make their own way, so the war carried on against Satan's kingdom was at first advanced by special miracles, but being sufficiently proved by them to be of God, we are now left to the ordinary assistance of divine Grace in Christ in the use of the Sword of the Spirit and need not look for hailstones nor the standing still of the sun. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who, through obedience to His precepts, have God on their side, need not be disturbed as to the number and power of their enemies. "More are those that are with us than those that are against us." 
Jos 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The roster of the kings of Canaan. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Kings, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 6, 7. The triumphs and grants of the law were glorious but those of the Gospel far exceed in glory. Jesus, the true Joshua, has provided for all the children of promise, spiritual blessings the privilege of His presence and heaven hereafter. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Fresh mercies must not drown the remembrance of former mercies, nor must the glory of present servants of God be allowed to diminish the honor due those who have gone before them, paving the way for later victories, (v. 6). 
Jos 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Joshua instructed concerning the division of the land. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Divide (the land), v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Joshua had the honor of dividing the land as Christ, the true Joshua, who has conquered for us the gates of hell and opened to us the gates of heaven, purchasing an eternal inheritance for all believers, will in due time, have the honor of putting them in possession. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All people, and especially old people, should set themselves to do that quickly which must be done before they die, lest death prevent them, vv. 1, 7. 
Jos 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Land divided, the portion of Caleb. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, Caleb, Eleazar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Divided (land), v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 11, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. Because it was formerly in God's promise, Caleb shows how he values the promise and insists on the mountain the Lord had spoken of. The man of faith values that which is given by promise far above that given by providence only.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Whatever we undertake, God's favorable presence with us is all in all to our success, therefore we should make sure of it by conformity to His will and an eye to His favor, vv. 8, 9. 
Jos 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Land divisions; the portion of Judah. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, Caleb, Othniel, Achsah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Borders. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. The blessings of the upper springs illustrate those which relate to our souls, and those of the nether springs speaks of those which relate to the body and the life that now is.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is no breach of God's law moderately to desire those comforts and conveniences of life which are attainable in a fair and regular way and will make us more efficient workmen for God.
Jos 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Land divisions; portions of Manasseh and Ephriam. <br><b>Characters</b> - None mentioned. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Borders, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is a brand of failure upon the Christian, when through carelessness, cowardice or want of faith in God, he fails to drive out the Canaanite (world) as commanded. Coveteousness often brings us into compromise and leads eventually to being infected with the world's idolatry. 
Jos 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Land divisions; portion for Manasseh. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, Eleazar, Moses, Zoplehad's daughter. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Portions, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13, 15, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 13. Many Christians try to serve their own ends by conniving with the Canaanites, whom Christ has distinctly commanded must be driven out. To thus court compromise with the world is to court failure. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - (v. 14). Many covet larger possessions who do not cultivate and make the best of what they have. If we would have more talents bestowed upon us, we should trade with those with which we are entrusted. 
Jos 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Tabernacle set up; apportionment of land to seven tribes. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, three surveyors. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Borders, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 3. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The setting up of the tabernacle (v. 1) in Shiloh, gives a hint that in the coming Shiloh (Christ) of whom Jacob had spoken, all the ordinances of the worldly sanctuary would have their accomplishment in a greater and more perfect tabernacle. Heb. 9:1, 11.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Many Christians stand in their own light and forsake their own mercies for the sake of lying vanities. With the title to a good land, given us by the sacrifice of Christ, we must not allow ourselves to be slack in possessing it all, because of seeming difficulties that are in the way. 
Jos 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Land divisions for six more tribes. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, Eleazar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Inheritance, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 47, 49. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. Within the lot of Zebulun were places made illustrious in the N. T. Within it was Nazareth where the Saviour spent so much of His time and mount Tabor on which He was transfigured and the coast of the Sea of Galilee on which He preached so many sermons and wrought so many miracles. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - (v. 49. The last served was the eldest and greatest man of Israel). Men in great public places should learn to prefer the common welfare before their own private satisfaction. 
Jos 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Cities of refuge. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Refuge, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Cities of refuge typify the relief which the Gospel provides for poor, penitent sinners and their protection from the curse of the law and the wrath of God, in our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom believers flee for refuge. Heb. 6:18.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Other refuge have we none, in any 'trouble, save Him in whom our trust is stayed.
Jos 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Land divisions; portions for Levites. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Inheritance, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 44, 45. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - There is an inheritance provided for all the saints, God's royal, priesthood (Levites) for which they must petition through the true Joshua, Christ who has said, "Ask, and it shall be given you." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God performs His promises to the utmost (v. 45) and if in anything the promise seems to come short, the saint must confess that upon himself rests all the blame. 
Jos 22:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Two and a half tribes dismissed to their homes. Altar of Reuben and Gad. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, Phinehas. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Witness, v. 27. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 18, 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 28. Those who have found the benefits of God's ordinances cannot but desire to perpetuate them upon their children and use all precaution lest their children cease from following the Lord Jesus. To this end the believer should set up a constant witness of Christ in the home. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Unhappy strifes will be prevented or soon healed by an impartial and favorable inquiry into that which is the matter of the offense. God, does, and men MUST often overlook the weakness of an honest zeal. 
Jos 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Last counsels of Joshua. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Counsel (said unto them), v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 6, 8, 10, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 16. The goodness of the heavenly Canaan and the thought of the possession they might have had, will aggravate the misery of those who shall be shut out from that which they might have enjoyed through God's free grace in Christ.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - As all good things come upon the believer according to the promise, so long as we have kept close to God, so all evil things will befall, according to His threatenings, if we forsake Him.
Jos 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Last charge of Joshua and his death. Eleazar's death. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joshua, Eleazar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Counsel, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 16, 20, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The book which began with triumphs here ends with funerals by which all the glory of man is stained. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - v. 15. It is the will of God that all should make religion their serious and deliberate choice and to resolve upon a life of godliness because upon honest investigation, it is found to be the best way. 
Jdg 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The incomplete victories of Judah, Benjamin and Manasseh.

Judah was the tribe out of which the Saviour sprang. Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, engaged the powers of darkness and in Him we are more than conquerors.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God appoints service according to the strength He has given (v. 2) but distrust of His power and promise, lose for us our advantages and run us into a thousand troubles.
Jdg 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Review of Israelitish invasion of Canaan up to Joshua's death. Results of incomplete obedience. Judges instituted. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, angel of Jehovah (Jesus) Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sold, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 18, 20, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The Angel of Jehovah, v. 1, was none other than Christ Himself. He seemed to come up from Gilgal, the place where their covenant had been renewed, of which they would be reminded. The remembrance of what we have received and heard from God, prepares us for special messages from Christ to hold fast. (Rev. 3:2, 3). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God never designed defeat for His own; let them be faithful to Him and they will find Him unchangeably constant to them. His covenants never break except on our side. 
Jdg 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Apostasies of Israel. Deliverances through Othniel, Ehud and Shamgar. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Othniel, Chushan-rishathian, Eglou, Ehud, Shamgar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Proved (tested), vv. 1, 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 15.<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 1, 2. War is sometimes God's will. When a country is exceedingly rich and fruitful, abounding with dainties of all sorts, if the people are not sometimes brought to know hardship, they are in danger of sinking into the utmost degree of luxury and effeminacy. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Man's memory is treacherous in that it easily forgets God and he must be repeatedly tested that God might be kept in sight. It often takes affliction to make him cry to God with importunity, when before he would scarcely think of Jehovah. A deliverer is always ready to answer the prayer of a contrite heart. 
Jdg 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Victories of Deborah and Barak. Characters: God, Jabin, Deborah, Barak, Sisera, Jael. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jabin, Deborah, Barak, Sisera, Jael. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prevailed, v. 24. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - It is a sure mark of apostasy in a nation when a woman is found in the place of leadership.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who slight God in their prosperity, will find themselves under a necessity of crying mightily to Him when they are in trouble. He is faithful in spite of our unfaithfulness, and when we sincerely turn to Him, He will give the victory.
Jdg 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Song of Deborah and Barak. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Deborah, Barak, Jael, Sisera, Shamgar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Song of praise, vv. 2, 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 20. "Stars fought" the elements were against Sisera. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When we have received mercy from God, we should be speedy in our returns of praise while the impressions of the mercy are fresh. Song is a good expedient for perpetuating the memory of God's special favors.
Jdg 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - More apostasy in Israel. Call of Gideon. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Angel of Jehovah (Jesus), Holy Spirit, Gideon, prophet, Joash. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Valour, v. 12, (in God's hands). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 34. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 24. Jehovah-shalom (God our peace). See Eph. 6:15. The peace of God, found alone in Christ who "is our peace," is the only preparation for intense conflict. In the midst of strife, one who has Christ for his peace, may be possessed of perfect tranquility within. If the Christian is called to battle, let him set up the altar of Jehovah-Shalom. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In times of apostasy, God often calls His mightiest servants from places of obscurity, and inspiring them with the assurance of the divine presence, He works through them great deliverances for His people. 
Jdg 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Gideon's three hundred and the victory over Midian and Amalek. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Gideon, Phurah, Oreb, Zeeb. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Victory, v. 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Empty pitchers (v. 16) type of earthly body, emptied of self (2 Cor. 4:7) but filled with God's Word, the lamp (Psa. 119:105). The pitcher was not to be spared in the advance, and the lamp was to be held forth (v. 20 Phil. 2:16). With the trumpet, the tidings of victory were sounded (Mark 16:15). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God wants prepared men to fight God's battles with God's weapons in God's way. A Christian's unfitness for the battle is often seen in the unconscious and trifling acts of his life, which betray his utter lack of faith, (v. 5). 
Jdg 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jealousy of Ephriam. Events to the death of Gideon. Apostasy. Characters: God, Gideon, Zebah, Zalmunna, Abimelech, Jerubbaal, Jether. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Gideon, Zebah, Zalmunna, Abimelech, Jerubbaal, Jether. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Snare, v. 27 (whoring, 27,33). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 23, 34. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 22. The Lord Jesus has delivered us out of the hands of our dangerous spiritual enemies, and it is fitting that He should rule over us. See Luke 1:24, 25.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Many are led into false ways by one false step of a good man (v. 27). False worship soon makes way for false deities.
Jdg 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Conspiracy of Abimelech. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Abimelech, Jerubbaal, Jocham, Gaal, Zebul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vengeance, vv. 24, 56. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 56. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Evil pursues sinners and sometimes overtakes them when they are apparently triumphant. The mighty things of the world may be confounded by the weakest, if God so wills.
Jdg 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Further apostasy; servitude to Philistines and Amorites. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Tola, Jair. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vexed, oppressed, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 14, 16. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The pleasures of sense, the gods of this world, cannot be our satisfaction (v. 14). True happiness and safety are only in God, to whom a true penitent will refer himself for correction as God may see fit, owning that his sin is highly malignant in its deserts (v. 10). 
Jdg 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeptha's awful vow and the victory over the Ammorites. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Jeptha, his daughter. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Subdued (enemy), v. 33. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 35, 36. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 30. One should be cautious and well advised in the making of vows, lest by indulging a present emotion even of pious zeal, they involve themselves in a great mistake. Jeptha's sacrifice is a figure of the great sacrifice of Christ. The daugh- ter was a chaste sacrifice, devoted to death by the father and so made a curse. She submitted after a period of agony, to her father's will.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - A Christian in the hands of the Spirit is assured of success in the undertaking to which God has called him. v. 29. 
Jdg 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Second jealousy of Ephriam. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeptha, Ibzan, Elon, Abdon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Envy, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Proud men think all the honors wasted that they themselves did not win. Envy brings serious contentions in the ranks of those who should be as one to fight God's battles. He who rolls the stone of reproach unjustly upon another, let him expect that it will justly return upon himself.
Jdg 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parents of Samson and Samson's birth. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Angel (Jesus), Holy Spirit, Manoah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Conceive, 3, 24. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 18, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 18. "Secret" is lit. "Wonderful," the name applied to Christ in Isa. 9:6. v. 22 declares they were face to face with God who is I manifested only in His Son. As the flame ascended from the altar He ascended. We owe the acceptance of all our praises and prayers to His mediation. It is Christ in our hearts by faith that makes our offering a sweet smelling savour. (God often overrules our mistakes to take occasion against the enemies of His Truth).<br><b>Conclusion</b> - A promise is given to try our faith and a precept to try our obedience for God requires both faith and obedience from those on whom He would bestow special favors. (It is desirable that our children be devoted to God even before their birth.)
Jdg 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Key Word</b> - Wife, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 19.<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - When God, by His providences, brings good out of evil to the followers of Christ when that which has threatened their ruin turns to their advantage and the wrath of men turns to His praise then comes meat out of the eater and sweetness out of the strong. 
Jdg 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Samson takes vengeance on the Philistines. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Samson, his family and friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Avenged, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - In the bursting of Samson's bands, we find an illustration of the way the Lord Jesus was loosed from the cords of death and came forth from the tomb and graveclothes. Thus, He triumphed over the powers of darkness that shouted against Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is nothing too hard or too much for him to do on whom the Holy Spirit comes in power, even though there are only the most contemptible instruments at hand with which to work (foxes, jawbone). 
Jdg 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Samson and Delilah; his fatal error and his death. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Samson, Delilah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Strength, v. 6, (departed, v. 20). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 20, 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Samson's strength was not in his hair but in his Nazarite consecration, of which his long hair was but a badge. By losing the badge, he forfeited the strength. What was real in Samson was his great faith in times of awful apostasy and God honored this faith. Heb. 11:32. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Beware of Satan who ruins men by rocking them to sleep, nattering them into a good opinion of their own safety, then robbing them of their strength and honor, leading them captive at his will. (God often leaves men to do foolish things to punish them for indulging in the lusts of uncleanness.) 
Jdg 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Micah's worship in self will. <br><b>Characters</b> - Micah, his mother, a Levite. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Graven image, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 13. Apostates who please themselves with their own delusions infer, if providence brings anything to their hands that helps them in their way, that God is pleased with them. With all false worship there is usually an exaltation of false priesthood, usurping the place of Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The love of money makes much mischief; destroys the duty and comfort of every relation and frequently leads to the setting up of a false worship. 
Jdg 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The Danite invasion. Civil and religious confusion. <br><b>Characters</b> - Micah, Jonathan, priests. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Seeking inheritance, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 24. An excellent definition of idolatry. Anything put in place of God, which man is concerned about as if life and comfort, hope and happiness were bound up in it, is an idol. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Many seek to justify themselves in their idolatrous impiety by the prosperity that seemingly attends them, not knowing that many are brought to destruction by their false security and that departing from the revealed will of God concerning worship is a dangerous move for a people to make. 
Jdg 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The Levite and his concubine. Wickedness of Gibeonites. <br><b>Characters</b> - Levite, concubine, her father. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Abused, 25. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - In the miserable end of this woman, we see the hand of God punishing her for her uncleanness. v. 2.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Because men like not to retain God in their knowledge, God gives them up to vile affection through which they dishonor themselves and turn His glory into shame. Rom. 1:24, 28.
Jdg 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Civil war in which the Benjamites are punished. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, a Levite, Phinehas. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vengeance, vv. 9, 28. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 18, 26. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We cannot expect the presence of God with us in our enterprises unless we seek it by humbling ourselves before Him. (v. 26). He is not under obligation to prosper us. Men are often so confident that God owes them His favor because they think their cause a good one, that they think it needless to humble themselves before God in penitence. 
Jdg 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Mourning for the lost tribe of Benjamin. <br><b>Characters</b> - God . <br><b>Key Word</b> - Depleted tribe, vv. 3, 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 25. Men should learn to be thankful for magistrates, both supreme and subordinate for they are ministers for God unto us for good. Any government is better than no government or anarchy. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There may be overdoing in well doing. Great care must be taken in the government of our zeal, for even necessary justice must be rendered with compassion. Many a war is ill-ended which was well begun. (2, 6, 13). 
Rth 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Naomi departs from Moab and returns with Ruth to Bethlehem. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Naomi, Ruth, Orpah, Elimelech, Mahlon, Chilion. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fidelity, v. 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Many have a value and affection for Christ yet come short of salvation by Him because they cannot find it in their hearts to forsake other things and attach themselves to Him. If we resolve that nothing shall separate us from our duty to Christ, we may be sure that nothing can ever separate us from happiness in Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When we take God for our Father we must take His people for our people though they be poor and despised. Those who forsake the communion of saints and return to the people of Moab will sooner or later break all communion with God and embrace the idols of Moab. 
Rth 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ruth serves Boaz who exercises a great kindness toward her. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ruth, Naomi, Boaz. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Favour, v. 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12,20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 22, 23. If we would benefit through Christ, we must adhere closely to Him, His fields and His servants. Has the Lord dealt bountifully with us? Let us not be found in any other field seeking happiness and satisfaction in the world.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God wisely orders small events and those that seem altogether contingent serve His own glory and supply the needs of His trusting people.
Rth 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ruth rests at the feet of Boaz. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ruth, Boaz, Naomi. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Rest, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The Lord Jesus is our Kinsman Redeemer. Through His incarnation He became kin to us as human beings that we, through the Spirit, might become betrothed to Him.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The married state should be a state of rest, when wandering affections are fixed in one who is fit, both temporally and spiritually to be a good husband.
Rth 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ruth finds reward in her marriage to Boaz. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Boaz, Ruth, Naomi, kinsman, Obed. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Kinsman redeemer, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - At vast expense, our Lord Jesus, the Bethlehemite Redeemer purchased the heavenly inheritance for us which by our sin was mortgaged and forfeited, and which of ourselves we could never have redeemed. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Fair and square dealings in all matters of contract and business is what all those must make conscience of who would approve themselves as "Israelites indeed without guile." 
1Sa 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The vow of Hannah and the birth of Samuel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Eli, Elkhanah, Hannah, Samuel, Peninnah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Bitterness, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 27, 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - True prayer may only be offered on the grounds of the sacrifice (v. 3). By Christ's offering, not only is atonement made for sin, but the audience and acceptance of our prayers is obtained for us. In all our supplications, we must have an eye to the Great Sacrifice. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Prayer is heart's ease to a gracious soul. If we seek on the basis of God's glory (v. 11) we shall be confident that we do not seek in vain. Prayer smoothes the countenance (v. 18). 
1Sa 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Hannah's prophetic prayer. Evil sons of Eli. Samuel in the tabernacle. The warning to Eli. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Hannah, Eli, Samuel, Hophni, Phinehas, Elkanah, a prophet. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Evil sons, v. 23. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 35. This had its full accomplishment in the priesthood of Christ, that faithful High Priest raised up of God when the Levitical priesthood was cast aside, who in all things did His Father's mind, and for whom God builds a sure house, built on a rock so that the gates of hell cannot prevail against it. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Nothing is more provoking to God than the profanation of sacred things and men serving their lusts with the offerings of the Lord. Those who allow and countenance their children in an evil way by not using their authority to restrain and punish them, involve themselves in their guilt and may be expected to be cast off from God's service. 
1Sa 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Samuel becomes Jehovah's prophet-priest. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Samuel, Eli. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Called, v. 4.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 18, 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - God's ministers must nourish a holy sensitiveness to sacred things, or callousness will lead them to some sin for which God will be compelled to lay them aside, (v. 13).<br><b>Conclusion</b> -  A child may have an ear for God's call; a mind for God's service and a message for God's bidding, for God will not be without a mouthpiece even though the ordained priesthood be deaf to His voice.
1Sa 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ark taken by Philistines. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Eli, Hophni, Phinehas, his wife, Ichabod. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Ark taken, vv. 11, 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Farewell, all in this world, if the ark, the token of Christ's presence with us, be lost.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - One may go forth with a Bible under the arm and a shout upon the lips and yet not have God Himself. Many who have estranged them- selves from the vitals of religion putting their confidence in the rituals of religion, find themselves with only a form of godliness without the power thereof.
1Sa 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ark of God a curse to Philistines. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Hand of the Lord, vv. 6, 9, 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Those who contend with God, His ark and the followers of His Beloved Son will invariably be ruined at last.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Sacred signs are not things that God is tied to or that man can trust to for blessing. His presence may be a savour of life unto life or of death unto death.
1Sa 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ark brought to Joshua. Characters : God . <br><b>Characters</b> - God .<br><b>Key Word</b> - Ark, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13,20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 13. The return of the ark (token of God's presence) and the revival of holy ordinances after days of restraint and trouble must be a matter of great joy to Christians. We must reverently use the tokens of God's grace through Christ or we will be made to sink under the tokens of His displeasure (v. 19). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Word of God in the hands of the world brings them condemnation (v. 2) causing them to seek to get rid of it. By refusing to part with their sins, sinners but lengthen out their own miseries (v. 4). 
1Sa 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ark brought to house of Abinadab. Revival of Mizpah. Victory at Eben-ezer. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Samuel, Eleazar, Abinadab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Return, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 8, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. The Christian should, as he passes along, set up his Ebenezers by which he will be reminded that "hitherto the Lord hath helped him" and by which he will give all the glory of his victories to God and His Son Jesus Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When we are truly sensible that by sin we have provoked God to withdraw from us and that we are undone if we continue in that state, if we make a solemn business of returning to God we may be assured we are on the way to a renewed prosperity and deliverance. 
1Sa 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Israel demands a king; theocracy rejected. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Samuel, his sons, Joel, Abiajah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - King, vv. 5, 19. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 9, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 20. For a professed Christian to want to live like the world means not only that he is displeasing Christ, but will at last find himself a dupe. It was God's will that Israel should have a king but in His own time. He must come of the tribe of Judah (Gen. 49:10). Because of Judah's sin (Gen. 38, Deut. 23:2) his line was prohibited from office for ten generations. David is found to be the first one to satisfy these conditions. (Matt. 1).<br><b>Conclusion</b> - When God's people will not accept His best for them, they will get the best they can be persuaded to take and, with the answer to their selfish prayers, will receive also an added judgment.
1Sa 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Saul chosen king. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Samuel, Saul, his servant, Kish. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Saul, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 21,25,27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 24. Note the suggestiveness of the dish set before Saul. The shoulder denotes strength; the breast which went with it denotes affection. Let all who are called to minister to Christ's people be reminded that a great responsibility is upon their shoulders and that the people should be dear to their bosom. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The wise God serves very great and certain purposes by seemingly small and casual affairs. Let us therefore remember that promotions come not by chance and that faithfulness and humility on the path of present duty are the key to exaltation at the hands of God. 
1Sa 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Saul annointed king. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Samuel, Saul, his uncle. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Annointed, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The sacred unctions point to the Great Messiah, the annointed One who was annointed with the oil of the Spirit without measure, above all priests or princes of earth. v. 19. Their obstinacy was a pressage of their rejecting Christ, in the rejecting of whom they cast off God that He should not reign over them.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Whom God calls He qualifies. When God works in us by His Spirit, it serves to confirm faith and furnish proof of a divine commission, v. 9.
1Sa 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Saul's victories at Jabesh-gilead. Kingdom renewed at Gilgal. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Saul, Samuel, Nahash. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Compromise (covenant) rejected, vv. 1, 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The right eye is the eye of faith. The left eye was covered with the shield. By the compromise they would be unfitted to fight. Thus Satan seeks to cripple the follower of Christ in service. A compromising saint is always blind in one eye.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Unless the Christian has forsaken his covenant with God, there is no occasion for his courting a covenant with the world by compromise. Through our King, we may have the victory.
1Sa 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Samuel's proclamation of the kingdom. Deliverances of God rehearsed. The sign of thunder and rain. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Samuel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Reason (counsel), v. 7.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14, 15, 22-25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 22. Had God chosen us on our good merits, we might fear He would cast us off for our bad merits, but choosing us in Christ before the foundation of the world, for His name's sake, He cannot lose us.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Religion has reason on its side (v. 7) which demonstrates that obedience to God is the happiness of men and disobedience to God is the ruin of men. [ey Word: Reason (counsel), v. 7. 
1Sa 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The self-will of Saul. He intrudes into the priests office. His divine rejection announced. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Samuel, Saul, Jonathan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Disobedience, v. 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 11. Scoffers of the latter days think the promise of Christ's return is broken because He does not come in their time, though it is certain that He will come "in such an hour as we think not." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Some lay great stress upon the external performances of religion, thinking thereby to excuse their ignorance of God Himself. Though enemies press, we are powerless to engage them without God Himself. We will make progress if we wait upon Him and become assured of divine power. Key Word: Disobedience, v. 13. 
1Sa 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jonathan's great victory over the Philistines. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jonathan, armor-bearer, Saul, Ahiah, Abner. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Delivered, v. 12.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 45.<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - To fail to feed upon the honey (Christ in the Word) vv. 25-30, is not time gained but strength lost, unfitting one for the conflicts.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let this strengthen the weak and encourage the timid, that no matter how few and feeble those are who seek to Him for direction and acknowledge Him in all their ways, God will give the victory. God can not only save us, but save by us, therefore let faith venture.
1Sa 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Saul's incomplete obedience and his rejection as king. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Samuel, Saul, Agag. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Disobedience, vv. 11, 19, (rejected, v. 23). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22, 24, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 20. We see how hard it is to convict the children of disobedience of their sin and strip them of their fig leaves, for they ever seek to justify themselves on the ground of their good intentions. Ceremonial observances cannot take the place of humble, sincere obedience to the will of God which requires full yieldedness to Jesus Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Some judge many things in their lives, but spare one Agag which the Lord has condemned. Partial obedience spells disobedience and in the absence of perfect obedience, our sacrifices are worthless, v. 22. 
1Sa 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Choice of David as king. His annointing and visit to Saul. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Samuel, David, Jesse, Saul, Bliab, Abinadab, Shammah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Chosen, v. 1, (annointed, v. 17). <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - David means "beloved" for he was a type of the Beloved Son. As David was called from the place of obscurity and contempt, so Christ came from a humble walk of life. David was first annointed by God ancj later by the people. (2 Sam. 2:4, 5:3). Christ was annointed at His baptism, and at His coming again, it will be ratified by His brethren, the Jews and all nations. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Whom God appoints, He annoints, and whom He annoints is truly qualified for service. 
1Sa 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Defiance of Israel by Goliath and David's victory over him. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Saul, Goliath, Eliab, Abinadab, Shammah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prevailed, v. 50. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 37, 47. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - David's victory over Goliath is a type of the triumph of the Son of God over Satan. Goliath is also a remarkable type of the antiChrist (note 6 pieces of armor, vv. 5-7). David annointed for the kingship but not yet in power is defied by the boastful champion whom he overcomes in the name of the Lord of Hosts. When Jesus comes as Lord of Hosts, anti-Christ will be destroyed by the brightness of His coming. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The battle is God's battle. If our confidence is purely in the power of God, rather than in any armor or sufficiency of our own, we may be certain the world's utmost might cannot withstand. God resists the proud and pours contempt upon those who bid defiance to His people, humiliating them by a defeat with the meanest of instruments. 
1Sa 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Love covenant of Jonathan and David. Saul's jealousy and attempts on David's life. Saul's daughter given to David. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Saul, Jonathan, Merab, Michal, Adriel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Envy (displeased), vv. 8, 29. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 3, 4. Jonathan's love is an illustration of the love the Lord Jesus has shown to us. He stripped Himself to clothe us; He even clothed Himself with our rags that we might be clothed upon with His glory. Phil. 2:5-7. v. 23. We should magnify the honor of being sons to the King of Kings. "Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us."<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The weeds of envy will grow if one thinks more of reputation than of duty. (vv. 7, 8). It is is a sign that the Spirit of God has departed from men, if they be continually envious and suspicious of those about them and cannot endure to hear anyone praised but themselves, v. 12. 
1Sa 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Saul's murderous hate pursues David. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, David, Saul, Jonathan, Michal, Samuel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Murderous envy, vv. 1, 10, 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The murderous attempts on the life of the annointed king by the usurping king, remind us of the repeated attempts of the usurper, Satan, against the life of God's Anointed One, Christ, when He was upon the earth.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God always raises up a friend for us in time of need. Envy allowed its way becomes murderous. Cut the claws of the tiger pup, lest it become a full grown tiger, when it is too late.
1Sa 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jonathan protects David. Their parting. Characters: God, David, Jonathan, Saul. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Jonathan, Saul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - True friend, v. 17, (loved as his own soul). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 42.<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. The covenant of Jonathan and David is an illustration of that between God and the Son on behalf of believers. John 10:28; Rom. 8:32-39. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Though the believer be despised of many, compelled to leave all comforts and part with best friends for Christ's sake, be this our comfort, that we have made an everlasting covenant with Jehovah who will exalt us in due time. 
1Sa 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David flees to Ahimelech and Achish. <br><b>Characters</b> - David, Ahimelech, Doeg, Achish. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Afraid, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 6. Jesus showed from this in Matt. 12:3 that ritual observances must at times give way to moral duties in case of urgent necessity, thus He justified His disciples in plucking corn on the Sabbath day. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If we would but trust God aright, we would not have to resort to miserable and dishonoring devices for our preservation in times of testing. 
1Sa 22:	<b>footnotes</b>
1Sa 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Wanderings and adventures of David. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Saul, Jonathan, Abiathar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Hunted (search him out), vv. 14, 23. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14, 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - As David might justly claim that his enemies rewarded him evil for good and that for his love they were his adversaries, so Christ was basely used. John 10:32.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Whatever befalls us, if we acknowledge God in all our ways and seek direction from Him, God will baffle the designs of the enemy and turn their counsels in our favor.
1Sa 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David's mercy to Saul in En-gedi. Characters: God, David, Saul. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Saul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Mercy (dealt well), v. 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - As David rendered good for evil to him from whom he had received evil for good, he was a type of Christ who saved His persecutors. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good. Key Word: Mercy (dealt well), v. 18. 
1Sa 25:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Samuel's death; David and Nabal. Abigail becomes David's wife, and also Ahinoam. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Samuel, Nabal, Abigail. <br><b>Key Word</b> - God avenges (returned the wickedness), v. 39. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 28, 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 44. Saul's defrauding David of his only rightful wife led him into the irregularity of having several wives. When the marriage knot is once loosed, it is seldom ever tied fast again. See Matt. 19:4, 5. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let the believer be encouraged to commit his cause to God when in any way injured, being assured that in His own good time God will redress the wrongs in His own way if we but sit still and leave the matter to Him. 
1Sa 26:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Saul spared by David a second time. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Saul, Abishai, Abner, Ahimelech. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Spared, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 24. As David's way to the throne lay through multiplied sorrows and difficulties, so does Christ's, who, though the anointed King with undisputed title, yet remains "meek and lowly" awaiting the set time.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - No questionable means need be employed to help out God's plans for our advancement (v. 10) God can weaken the strongest and befool the wisest on our behalf. Wait His time.
1Sa 27:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David down in the dumps. <br><b>Characters</b> - David, Schish, Ahmoan, Abigail. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Discouragement (I shall perish), v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Unbelief is a sin that besets those who have been undergoing long trials. It is no advantage to us when we are in the dumps, to cross over the borders into the world for comfort, for we cannot expect God's protection when we are out of His will. 
1Sa 28:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David among Israel's enemies. Saul consults the witch. Characters: God, David, Saul, Samuel, Achish, witch. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Saul, Samuel, Achish, witch. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Spiritism, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 8. Never did Saul look so mean as when he went sneaking to a spiritist at night. Such works are of the darkness and cannot bear the light. Either Satan had Samuel impersonated, or else God on this occasion, actually sent back the spirit of Samuel, that Saul might get an answer to his design and should be given up to strong delusions. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Seek the Lord while He may be found for there is a time when He will not be found (v. 6). To think that any spiritualistic medium can be of help when God has frowned upon us, is to heap contempt upon God, who has expressly forbidden all such recourse.
1Sa 29:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David saved from fighting against Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - David, Achish. <br><b>Key Word</b> - 111 favor, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's providence orders wisely and graciously for His children even when they have sadly erred. Even the ill favor of men may turn out to be for our good that a door might be opened for deliverance out of straits our own folly have brought us into. 
1Sa 30:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David avenges the destruction of Ziglag. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Abiathar, an Egyptian. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Recovered, vv. 8, 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When we go abroad to tarry for a while with the enemies of God's people, we may expect to be met with evil tidings when we return home again. In the mercy of God, we can even then, if called according to His purpose, encourage ourselves in God and be assured that He will overrule and bring light out of darkness and peace out of trouble. 
1Sa 31:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Death of Saul and Jonathan. <br><b>Characters</b> - Saul, Jonathan, Abinadab, Melchi-shua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Defeat, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The book which began with the birth of a godly man ends with the burial of a wicked man. Let the two lives teach us to prefer the honor that comes from God rather than that which Satan pretends to bestow. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - As men live, so will they die. Those are indeed in a deplorable condition, who, despairing of the mercy of God, would leap into a hell before them thinking to escape the hell within them. We all need to pray, "lead us not into temptation." 
2Sa 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David mourns the death of Saul and Jonathan. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Saul, Jonathan, an Amalekite. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Mourned, vv. 12, 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 26, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 13. The killing of the Amalekite who brought the message was just. David made him own a second time that he was an Amalekite and in slaying him, David did what his predecessor should have done and was rejected for not doing. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - He that is deeply concerned for the honor of God cannot rejoice in the afflictions that come upon his enemies. In the disgrace that comes upon them, let us not forget their former successes and real service. 
2Sa 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David received as King of Judah. Abner makes Ish-bosheth king <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Abner, Ish-bosheth, Joab, Abishai, Asahel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Annointed, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. Jesus first presented Himself to Judah. Thus, like David, His kingdom is set up by degrees. He is Lord of all by divine designation but we see not yet all things put under His feet.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God, David, Abner, Ish-bosheth, Joab, Abishai, Asahel. Conclusion: We may expect, one upon another, trials of our faith in the promises of God and of our patience, whether we can wait God's time for the performances of the promises.
2Sa 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Abner deserts to David. Joab's murder of Abner. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Joab, Abner, Ish-bosheth, Michal, Phaltiel, Rizpeh, Abishai, Asahel.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Great man fallen, v. 38. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 37. The servants of the King of Kings do many things thinking to further His Kingdom, that have not His sanction and will bring trouble upon the heads of those who do them in His name without His leading.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Evil pursues sinners and will overtake them at the last in one way or another. (Illustrated both in the case of Abner and that of Joab, v. 29).
2Sa 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Murder of Ish-bosheth. <br><b>Characters</b> - David, Ish-bosheth, Mephibosheth, Baanahm, Rechab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Murder, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 9. God had hitherto helped him in his difficulties and in coming to the throne, David would therefore depend upon Him and not the devices of men to complete His purpose. Let this teach us that Jesus Christ is coming to the throne, not by man dragging in the millenium but by the hand of God Himself. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The guilt of blood brings a curse, and if men do not avenge it, God will. 
2Sa 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David becomes king over Israel. War with Philistines. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Hiram. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Annointed, v. 3, (victory, v. 25). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - David was recognized as king on three counts. (1) Of their flesh, v. 1. Christ, Matt. 25:40. (2) Their leader in battle, v. 2. Christ, Josh. 5:13-15. (3) Designated by God, v. 2. So also Christ, Rom. 3:25. As David had three annointings; one by God, one by Judah and one by all tribes, so Christ was annointed at His baptism, will be received of the Jews and later of all nations. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who have the Lord of Hosts for them need have no fear what hosts of men or demons can do against them. If we grow great and win many victories, we can only ascribe our advancement to -God's favor with us. 
2Sa 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David seeks to bring the ark to Jerusalem. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Michal, Uzzah, Obed-edom, Abinadab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Ark, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Careful directions had been given how the ark must be borne. Num. 4:1-15. David adopted a Philistine method. 1 Sam. 6:7, 8. We cannot expect God's blessing if we employ heathen methods in doing the work of Christ's church. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God will have His work done in His own way and cannot bless us if we carry it on under wrong principles. We need to seek His directions continually lest we do good things in a wrong way. 
2Sa 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David's desire to build the Lord's house. The Davidic covenant. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Nathan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Established (kingdom), v. 16, (confirmed, v. 24). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14, 22, 25.<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The covenant confirmed to David by the oath of Jehovah and renewed to Mary by the angel Gabriel, is immutable, and God will yet give to the thorn-crowned King the throne of His Father David forever. Luke 1:31-33; Acts 2:29-33, 15:1-17. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We need no more to make us happy than to have God for a Father to us. If He is our Father, we must be dutiful children, or expect His chastisements, which are an article of the covenant and which flow from His father-love. 
2Sa 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Full establishment of David's kingdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Hadadezer, Joram, Toi. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Reigning, v. 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The Son of David shall at length put down all principality and power and take the throne. He has, as David had, a line to kill and a line to save. The Gospel is to some a savor of life unto life and to others a savor of death unto death.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - After the long and frequent struggles which the Christian has with the powers of darkness, he shall at last be made more than conqueror and shall reign with Christ. 
2Sa 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David's kindness to Mephibosheth. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Mephibosheth, Ziba, Machir, Micha. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Kindness, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The story gives us a picture of salvation by God's grace in Christ. Grace comes to the helpless, those "sold under sin;" invites us to the place of peace and satisfaction; feasts us at God's table; keeps our lame feet out of sight. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Kindness is one of the laws of Christianity and the Christian should seek opportunity of doing good. The most necessitous are generally the least clamorous and the best objects of our kindness and charity are such as will be discovered only through our inquiry. 
2Sa 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The Ammonite-Syrian war. <br><b>Characters</b> - David, Joab, Abishai, Hanun, Hadarezer, Shobach. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Kindness misinterpreted, vv. 2, 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 5. The Christian may learn not to lay too much to heart the reproaches he receives for Christ's sake, for they will soon wear off and turn eventually to the shame of their authors. "God will bring forth thy righteousness as the light wait patiently for Him." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - False men are ready to think all others as false as themselves. There is nothing so well meant but that it may be misinterpreted, and is likely to be so by men who love nobody but themselves. ''Love thinketh no evil." 
2Sa 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David's great sin. <br><b>Characters</b> - David, Uriah, Bathsheba, Joab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Adultery, v. 4, (murder, v. 15). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - We need to bear in mind that as the chosen seed through which Messiah was to come, David and others of the direct line had the combined forces of evil against them to accomplish, if possible their downfall. Of all men, they should have walked in hourly dependence on God. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - A Christian with natural tendencies to sensuality may have cravings even when the general bent of his mind is to live in God's will. The devil finds work for idle hands to do (v. 1) and we should therefore be warned of the danger of having nothing in particular to do. Sin started leads to more sin to hide it. After all, the atmosphere of trial and difficulty is the occasion of highest strength. 
2Sa 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David's rebuke and repentance. Birth of Solomon. Ammonite victory. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Nathan, Bathsheba, Joab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Confession and restoration, v. 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13, 22, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - God always has His man for His work and while it may cost the man nights of pain and prayer to deliver the message of Christ he may be sure that if God sent him, his message will accomplish its purpose. A dogmatic message is truer and more tender than soft speeches that do not arouse conscience. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If the believer, brought face to face with his sins sincerely confesses and repents of them, he may be restored to fellowship, although God will not interfere with the consequences in this life, v. 1. 
2Sa 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ammon's crime. Absalom's vengeance for Tamar's wrong. <br><b>Characters</b> - David, Absalom, Ammon, Tamar, Jonadab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Shame, v. 13, (avenged, v. 32). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. Those who are peculiarly beautiful have no reason, on that account to be proud, but great reason to stand upon their guard.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Fleshly lusts are their own punishment and not only war against the soul but against the body also, and are the rottenness of the bones. The sin of adultery makes awful mischief in families and the sinner serves a hard master.
2Sa 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The recall of Absalom and David's forgiveness. Characters: God, David, Joab, Absalom, woman of Tekoah, Tamar. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Joab, Absalom, woman of Tekoah, Tamar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Forgiven, v. 33. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 33. If the compassion of a father prevails to reconcile him to an impenitent son, shall penitent sinners doubt the compassion of God, in His Son, when they truly come to Him?<br><b>Conclusion</b> - If we let private affections stand in the way of public duty (See Gen. 9:6) we may justly expect that God will make the one whom our foolish pity spares, a scourge upon us.
2Sa 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Absalom steals the love of ten tribes. David's flight. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Absalom, Ittai, Zadok, Abiathar, Hushai, Ahimaaz, Jonathan, Ahitophel.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Conspiracy, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 25, 26. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The mother of this rebellious son was the daughter of a heathen king. David, in this unhappy issue of the marriage, has to smart for being unequally yoked with an unbeliever.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - He who steals one heart away from another by means of innuen- dos is the vilest of robbers, and especially when professed devotion to God is used as a pretext to carry out the design, (v. 7).
2Sa 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - False servant of Mephibosheth. Shimea curses David. Absalom takes Jerusalem. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Abishai, Ziba, Shimei, Absalom, Hushai, Ahitophel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Cursed, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 9. David is herein a type of Christ who rebuked his disciples, who in zeal for His honor, would have used their miraculous powers on the heads of those who affronted Him. (Luke 9:55).<br><b>Conclusion</b> - A humble and tender spirit will turn reproaches into reproofs and so get good by them instead of being provoked at them. The world's smiles are more dangerous than its frowns.
2Sa 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Conflicting counsel of Ahitophel and Hushai. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Absalom, Ahitophel, Hushai, Shobi, Machir, Barzillai, Ahimaaz, Jonathan, Amasa, Joab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Counsel, v. 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 27, 28, 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Absalom is a type of the false Messiah, who will gather an army against Christ the Greater David (Rev. 19:19), meeting his defeat in the brightness of Christ's coming.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is to the comfort of all who fear God that He has an overruling hand in all counsels and a negative voice in all resolves, and laughs at men's projects against His annointed ones.
2Sa 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Battle of Mount Ephriam. Slaying of Absalom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Absalom, Joab, Abishai, Ittai, Ahimaaz, a Cushite. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Avenged, v. 31. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 31, 33. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - As the false king was cast into a pit, so anti-Christ will be thrown into the bottomless pit at the coming of Christ, and then every tongue shall confess that Christ is King of Kings.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who exalt themselves shall be abased. It never pays to take counsel against the Lord and His annointed.
2Sa 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Joab reproaches David's return to the throne. <br><b>Characters</b> - David, Joab, Zadok, Abiathar, Shimei, Ziba, Abishai, Mephibosheth, Barzillai, Chimham, Amasa. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Return, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 14, 15. Our Lord Jesus will rule in those who invite Him to the throne of their hearts, and not until He is invited.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - A good man and a good cause will again recover their credit and interest, though, for a time, they may seem to have lost them. The good services done will still be remembered when men come to their right minds.
2Sa 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Joab murders Amasa. Suppression of Sheba's revolt. <br><b>Characters</b> - David, Joab, Amasa, Sheba, Abishai. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Traitor, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 12, 13. Wicked men think themselves safe if they can just conceal it from the eye of the world. The covering of blood with a cloth cannot stop its cry for vengeance in God's ears.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - We must not think it strange while in this world if the end of one trouble be the beginning of another, but God will bring us victoriously through them all, if we but trust in His wisdom.
2Sa 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Three years famine. Saul's sons slain. War with Philistines. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Rizpah, Ishbi-benab, Abishai, Sebechai, Saph, Elhanan, Jonathan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Recompense (atonement) v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 9, 13, 14. Through Christ who was hanged and made a curse for us to expiate our guilt, though He was Himself guiltless, God is entreated for us. In token of the completeness of the sacrifice they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in the sepulchre. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When we are under God's judgments, we should enquire the grounds of the controversy, and when the cause is revealed, should go to all lengths to make right the wrongs of the past, that God's full blessing may be renewed upon us. 
2Sa 22:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David's song of deliverance. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Praise, vv. 4, 50. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3, 4, 31, 33, 48. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - No believer has so little from God but there is ground for praise, nor so much but that he has need to call upon God. Praise is the blossom of prayer.
2Sa 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Last words of David. Deeds of his mighty men. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, David, Joshebbasheth, Adino, Bleazar, Shammah, Abishai, Benaiah, other great men. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Mighty men, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 3, 5. The verses have a prophetic application to Christ who is to be the just ruler, ordering all things according to His Father's will, and who will be as the light of the morning.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who have ventured themselves for the good of the public are worthy of double honor, both to be respected by their fellow citizens and to be remembered by their posterity. Though our deeds be not recorded by men, they are recorded in heaven.
2Sa 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David's sin in numbering the people. His choice of punishment. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, angel (Jesus), Joab, David, Gad, Araunah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sinned, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 25. Christ is our altar and sacrifice. Through Him alone may we expect to get favor with God and to escape His wrath for our sins. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God does not judge of sin as we do. What appears to us to be but a small offense, may be a great sin in the eyes of God who knows men's principles, being a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. His judgments are according to the truth. 
1Ki 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David's declining strength. Adonijah plots to seize kingdon. Counter plot of Nathan and Bath-sheba. Solomon annointed. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Solomon, (Adonijah), Joab, Nathan, Bath-sheba, Zadok, Benaiah, Abiathar, Jonathan, Abishag, Shimei, Rei. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Self-exalted, v. 5 (humbled, v. 50). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 29, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 39. Solomon is a type of Christ as Prince of Peace, (Isa. 9: 6; 1 Chron, 22:9) Jesus will not fulfill the Solomon type until He has fulfilled the David type. Chosen before born (Isa. 42:1) Rode into Jerusalem on a mule (Jn. 12:14-16) Annointed (Acts 10:38) Peace filled the earth when His reign was finally set up (Zech. 14:9). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When men exalt themselves, God very often leaves them to themselves until they are corrected with a scourge of their own making. He that in the morning grasps at a crown, may before night be forced to hold to the horns of the altar and beg for life. God will be consulted. 
1Ki 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David's charge to Solomon, David's death. Execution of Adonijah. Abiathar removed. Execution of Shimei.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, David, Solomon, Bath-sheba, Adonijah, Abishag, Joab, Abiatha, Benaiah, Shimei.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Punishment, vv. 5, 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The punishment of sin may be slow of foot but it is sure of nose and will at length find the offender. Even a hoary head, ought not to be any man's protection from justice.
1Ki 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Alliance of Solomon and Pharoah. Marriage with Pharoah's daughter. Loses at Gibeon. Solomon's prayer. His wisdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon, two women. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Wisdom, vv. 9, 28. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Wisdom: Its beginning, Psa. 111:10. Its source, Dan. 2:2022. Its quality, Jas. 3:17. Way to it, 1 Cor. 3:18. Personification of it, 1 Cor. 1:30. How to obtain it, Jas. 1:5. Who is it for, Mt. 7:24-25. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The wisdom of God is laid up for those who have the spirit of a child (Lk. 10:21) vv. 8, 9. A knowledge of our own limitations is very essential to true success, if we have learned that the power of the omnipotent God is at our disposal. 
1Ki 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Princes and commissaries of Israel. Solomon's reign and wisdom. Characters: God, Solomon. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Safety, v. 25. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 25<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Solomon was a type of Christ in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden for a use for "He is made unto us wisdom."<br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is spiritual peace and joy and a holy security for all faithful subjects of God's Annointed One. Key Word: Safety, v. 25. 
1Ki 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Preparation for building the temple. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon, Hiram. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Temple, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 17. The costly stones speak of Christ who was laid for the foundation of the spiritual temple, an elect and precious stone. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Satan does all he can to hinder the work of God's temple, but when he is withheld for a time, we should be extra zealous in that which is good that we might carry it forward to completion. (Acts 9:31). 
1Ki 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Work on the temple begun. Dimensions and materials. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Finished, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Christ is the true Temple (Jn. 2:21). God Himself prepared Him (Eph. 1:4; Heb. 10:5). In Him all God's spiritual children meet and through Him have access to God.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - We should not mistake noise and notoriety for spiritual progress (v. 7). Quietness and order both become and befriend the carrying on of spiritual work.
1Ki 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Work on the temple and Solomon's house. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon, Hiram. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Work ended, v. 51. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 51. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The temple is not only a type of Christ but of the believer who is also spoken of as a temple, or habitation of God. (1 Cor. 3:16-17; 6:19). It should be as beautiful as the Holy Spirit can make it, therefore we should be yielded to His master strokes.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God who is best should be served and honored with our best. 
1Ki 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ark brought in; Skekinah glory fills the temple. Solomon's sermon. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Dedicated (filled with glory) v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 27, 57, 58, 61. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - It is a great thing when a nation's ruler can be led of the Spirit in prayer and when he realizes that all answer to prayer is only on the ground of the shed blood of Christ, vv. 22, 62. (Heb. 9:22; 10:19-20). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All cost and pains are lost on stately structures unless God has been in .the work, and if He fails to manifest His glory in them, they are after all but a ruinous heap. A temple without the ark and the glory are like a candlestick without a candle. 
1Ki 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah appears to Solomon. Covenant made. Solomon's fame. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon, Hiram. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Covenant, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. (Israel shall be a byword) lit. a "sheninah." Some have thought that the epithet "sheeney" used in speaking disgustingly of Jews throughout the centuries, came from this prophecy.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God deals plainly with men and sets before them blessing or cursing. God never fails to perform His part of a covenant and if we improve the grace He is willing to give, He will confirm us to the end.
1Ki 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Solomon and the queen of Sheba. His revenue and splendor. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon, queen of Sheba. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fame, vv. 7, 23. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Mt. 12:42. Christ mentions this queen's inquiry after God through Solomon as showing the stupidity of those who would not enquire after God through Jesus Christ who was God manifest in the flesh and therefore better able to instruct them than anyone else. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - That fame is true fame which has associated with it the name of the Lord and which challenges inquiry into the means of God's grace. 
1Ki 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Solomon's heart turned. Chastened of God. Rise of Jeroboam. Death of Solomon. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon, Hadad, Pharaoh, Rezon, Jeroboam, Adoram, Ahijah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Backslidden, v. 9 (heart turned). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 32. The house of David must, in spite of everything be kept intact, because out of it was to come the Messiah. As it was spared on account of the promise to David, so all God's favors shown to us are for Christ's sake and the covenant made with Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The way of sin is down hill and those who get into it cannot easily get untangled. God at first appointed one woman for one man, and he who thinks one not enough, will not be satisfied with two. When our love is set on the things of the flesh, we may be sure we have lost our love for God and are on the way to trouble. 
1Ki 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Accession and folly of Rehoboam. Kingdom divided. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Rehoboam, Jeroboam, Adoram, Shemiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Counsel forsaken, vv. 8, 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The golden calf was set up where the first altar to God had been placed (v. 29 Gen. 12:8). All isms originate in man's heart (v. 26), have a selfish purpose back of them (v. 27-29) and are launched on a pretense that it is for the people's good; yet always tend to sin and idolatry. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Taking the counsel of unspiritual men always spells blunder and a rough answer never fails to bring division. If we make God the source of our counsel (Jas. 3:15) we will avoid all folly.

Herein Elijah is a type of Christ as our provider.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God can wonderfully raise up servants and suit them to the work He designs them for.

He who bows lowest in the presence of God will be able to stand straightest in the presence of sin.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The man of faith need not be afraid to risk his all on the honor of God (v. 23). Let opposers who talk of the failure of Christianity, do what it does bring down the consuming, cleansing, illuminating power of God into the lives of men.

Heb. 12:18.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Even though we faint in our faith, God abideth faithful. The best thing for a discouraged man is to get where he can see from God's viewpoint (v. 11) which he can do only by coming before God in prayer.

(Defeat, v. 37). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. The greatest kindness possible to a person going on a dangerous path is to tell them God's truth, as it is in Christ. Through self-styled prophets multitudes are led on their way to destruction. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - He who joins himself in affinity with vicious men, rejects the counsels of God and hates the preachers of God's Word, will find that no masquerade will hide him from God's judgment and that no armor is proof against His vengeance.

Elijah's deliverance. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, angel (Jesus), Elijah, Ahaziah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prediction, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. All heaven is interested in Christ's true servants. Who can harm those whom God will shelter? <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who will not inquire of the Word of God for their comfort will be made to listen to it, whether they wish it or not. To consult with the devil's agents as to fortune means departure from God.

Jordan means "judgment" Christ and the believer go together (v. 8) through the judgment of the cross. Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:3. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who know they are soon going to heaven should be concerned for those they are leaving behind to carry on God's service and to leave with them their experiences, testimonies, counsels and prayers.

He who has power from God to satisfy the deepest needs of man will never want for applicants.

Incurable by human power, Jer. 13:23. 7. Its only cure, the power of Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is little hope for one who is more concerned about his dignity than his disease, but full blessing is assured to one who will humble himself as a little child and walk in the light of God's commands.

Seige of Samaria by Syrians. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Elisha, Ben-hadad, Jehoram, nameless woman. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Man of God, v. 9 (Prayer, v. 17). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 6. The God of nature is not tied up to its laws. As He raised the iron against the natural laws, so His grace can raise the iron heart which has sunk into the mud of this world and raise up affections naturally earthly to things above. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Christian on his knees can see more than the philosopher on his tiptoes. They who fight against God are given up to delusions, not knowing that the believer has God, (Rom. 8:13) Christ, (Mt. 28:20) the Holy Spirit, (Jn. 16:16-17) and angels (Heb. 1:14) on his side. 
2Ki 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's terror upon the Syrians. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Elisha, Jehoram, captain of Israel, four lepers. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Promise fulfilled, vv. 1, 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 6, 7. The wicked flee when no man pursues. God can, if He wills, dispirit the boldest and most brave enemy of Christ's cause, and make the stoutest heart to tremble at the shaking of a leaf.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Faith expects from God what is beyond all human expectation. They who cannot find it in their hearts to take God at His Word, forfeit all benefits of His promises.

Men who have no religion commonly look upon follow- ers of Christ as mad. Of the Savior they said, "He is beside himself."Of John, "He has a devil." Of Paul, "Much learning hath made thee mad."<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God doesn't always pay up for sin every week, but in the end, He pays. He is known by His judgments.

If we aim at the applause of men and make their praise our highest aim, instead of the honor of Christ, we are upon a false bottom. An upright heart approves itself to God and covets no more than His acceptance. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God is not the author of any man's sin, but even by that which men do from bad principles, He serves His own purposes and takes vengeance on those who have defied Him. 
2Ki 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Royal seed of Judah destroyed. Joash becomes king. Execution of. Athaliah.

Moses, Heb. 11:23; Joash, v. 3. Christ, Mt. 2:12-16.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - All attempts to frustrate God's revealed purpose are foolish and bound to be fruitless. Who can disannul what God has purposed? Though the promise be bound up in one life, yet will it not fail.

Repair of the temple. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joash, Jehoida, Hazael. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Repairing temple, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 9.

The last one is in Mk. 12:4.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who are entrusted with public money for the carrying on of God's work should learn to deal faithfully, as those who know God will reckon with them, if men do not. Loose financial methods in the church dishonor God.

Elisha's death and the miracle at his tomb. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Elisha, Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Hazael. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Gracious, v. 23. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. It is much to our spiritual advantage to attend the death beds of Christlike men that we might hear their last counsels. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The slowness of God's processes against sinners must be construed to the honor of His mercy, not to the impeachment of His justice (v. 23). It is of the Lord's mercies, that they are not consumed.

Reign of Jeroboam in Jerusalem. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Amaziah, Jehoash, Jeroboam, Jonah, Azariah.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Defeat, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 26, 27. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who are too eager, through pride, to fight, may get enough of it in quick order.

Assyrians take Damascus. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ahaz, Tiglath-pileser, Urijah, Rezin, Pekah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Abominations, v. 3. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - That religion is of no worth which is guided by fancy instead of faith (v. 10). The hearts of idolaters walk after their eyes.

The sins of Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Hoshea, Shalmaneser, So. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Carried away, vv. 6, 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13, 14, 37, 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. From this captivity, Israel has never been restored to Palestine. See Deut. 28:15-68. A remnant of Judah returned but the national restoration is yet to be fulfilled.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who forget God may themselves expect to b* forgotten. Those who try to be like the world may expect to be swallovtfd up by the world. Those who will not serve God in their own land j*t6d not be surprised if they are forced to serve enemies in a strange lane. 
2Ki 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Reign and revival of Hezekiah over Judah. Victory over Phillistines. Invasion of Sennacherib.

Thus Satan steals a man's watch and explains it so well, the victim gives him his coat and vest. 
2Ki 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Hezekiah's message to Isaiah and the answer. Sennacherib defies God. Hezekiah's prayer and the answer through Isaiah. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, angel (Jesus), Hezekiah, Isaiah, Sennacherib, Eliakim, Shebna, Rab-shakeh. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prayer answered, vv. 19, 34. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 34. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 30. The remnant shall yet again be planted in their own habitations and shall take root there and grow rich. That soul is indeed prosperous who takes root downward by faith in Christ, and then becomes fruitful upward in righteousness. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Prayer changes things. If the motive of our prayer is the honor of God, we may be sure He will graciously and copiously answer, being able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. 
2Ki 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Hezekiah's illness and recovery. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Hezekiah, Isaiah, Berodach-baladan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Healed, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. It is duty to make use of legitimate means to assist nature when we are sick, unless God has by a special revelation made it clear that He intends to heal entirely by miraculous power. Medicines are God-given and He has graciously made them serviceable to man in consideration of the poor. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Neither greatness nor goodness can exempt us from sickness, yet often when the death sentence has apparently been received within the body, it is reversible through Spirit-born, faith-filled prayer.

When man finds the Word, the Word is quick to find him and convict him of sin. Either sin keeps one from the Book or the Book keeps one from sin. 
2Ki 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Law read to the people.

Ephriam had been promised a seed that should become a multitude (Gen. 48:19) and here the promise seems defeated. God's providences many times seem to contradict His promises, but eventually God makes the promise more illustrious by wonderfully fulfilling it. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - (v. 22). It is often the burden of those who live to be old that they see their children go before them. It is a brotherly and friendly office on the part of the Christian, to comfort such in their afflictions with the Word of God.

The stock of Saul and Jonathan. <br><b>Characters</b> - Ehud, Saul, Jonathan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Genealogy. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - (v. 40).

Nothing shows more accurately what we are than the way in which we stand in the presence of trial and difficulty.

Men will embrace anything that will relieve pain and distemper of body and hence Satan uses physical ailments to try and draw men from God. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - One of the greatest evidences of God's love to those who love Him is to send them affliction, with grace to bear it. If trial makes us complain against God, then the devil laughs and is glad. Trial is the school of trust. (1 Pet. 1:7). 
Job 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job tells his misery and despair. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Curse, v. 1. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. Though many, because of distrust, have cursed the day of their birth, yet no one ever curses the day of their "new birth" nor wishes they had never found Christ as their Saviour. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - "Pity thyself" is the devil's most popular sermon to one who will listen to him, for he delights to embitter the saint by causing him to misunderstand God's providences. Remember that God's worst is better than the devil's best and if our circumstances find us in God, we shall find God in all our circumstances.

The best and truest comfort is from God's Word. Rom. 15:4. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who pass rash and uncharitable censures upon their brethren, do Satan's work. We should be careful not to add affliction to saints who are already in grief, unless we are certain we have a God-given message to deliver.
Job 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Eliphaz's discourse continued. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Eliphaz, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Chastisement, v. 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 8, 17, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Fellowship in Christ's sufferings is the qualification for sharing His dignity. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Even Satan may be God's servant to make better saints of us, the blow at the outward man proving the greatest blessing to the inward man. We should therefore be more desirous of knowing God's purpose in our trouble than of getting out of it. 
Job 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer to Eliphaz. His appeal for pity. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Eliphaz, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Pity, vv. 14, 28. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - See 1 Pet. 2:20-23. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - No one can judge another justly without much prayer for divine guidance. Affliction does not necessarily prove one to be a hypocrite or a wicked man.
Job 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer to Eliphaz continued. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, Eliphaz. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Complaint, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 11. It is better to die praising Jesus and praying than complaining and fretting. The only time our Lord ever asked "why" was when He bore the world's sin and the Father's face was turned away. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We believe in the sun even when it is hidden behind a cloud, therefore we should not doubt the goodness of God when His face seems for a time to be hidden from us. The Great Physician has never taken down a wrong bottle. 
Job 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Bildad's theory of Job's affliction. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Bildad, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Hypocrisy, v. 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13,20,22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Let the afflicted one include the Lord Jesus in his faith and he will eventually be vindicated in the sight of men.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is not just or charitable to argue that merely because one is in deep affliction, he is therefore a hypocrite. Let us "judge nothing before the time." A day is coming when the secrets of God's providence will be solved to universal satisfaction.
Job 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job answers Bildad, denying he is a hypocrite. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, Bildad. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Complaint, v. 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 20, 32. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - 2, 3, 33. While it may be possible for us to vindicate our own integrity to friends, we can never plead our integrity for our justification before God. Were it not that the believer stands in Christ's righteousness, he would have no ground whatever before God. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Man is an unequal match for his Maker, either in dispute or combat. If God should deal with any of us according to our deserts, we should certainly be undone.
Job 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer to Bildad continued. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, Bildad. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Complaint, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. The Christian's comfort is that he is "in Christ" and that although he is afflicted, there is no condemnation. (Rom. 8:1). He is chastised that he might not be condemned with the world. (1. Cor. 11:32). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Sometimes, when in affliction, the believer is tempted to think that God's providences and His justice cannot be reconciled. Faith and patience would keep us from being weary of our lives and would show us that when God contends with us, there is always some good purpose in it. 
Job 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Zophar's theory of Job's condition. He thinks Job a hypocrite and liar. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Zophar, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Liar, mocker, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 14, 15, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Zophar is a type of the religious dogmatist who thinks he knows all about God's ways and exactly what God will do in each individual case. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those are not always in the right who are most forward to express their judgment and to conclude that if God should speak, He would agree with them. We should seek to put the best possible construction upon the words and actions of our brethren that they will bear, lest we add to their afflictions. 
Job 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job answers his three friends, extolling God's wisdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, three friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Hand of God, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. Nothing is more grievous to one who has fallen from prosperity into adversity than to be insulted when he is down. Our Lord Jesus is the wisest and kindest of comforters. To Him let us go in all our troubles. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is a wise providence which guides and governs all things by rules with which the wisest men are but imperfectly acquainted. The afflicted one should learn to acquiesce in His disposals and the one who is tempted to criticise and censure should learn not to be over-wise in his expressions of judgment. 
Job 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer to three friends continued. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, three friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Reasoning, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. Those who walk in unbroken fellowship with Christ, having assurance there is no unconfessed sin in their lives, may cheerfully welcome every event, being in readiness for it. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We should presevere in the way of duty, though it cost us all that is dear to us in this world, rejoicing in God when there is nothing else to rejoice in, knowing that the "sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us." 
Job 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer to his friends continued. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Trouble, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. Though our friends prove miserable comforters, the believer may rejoice in all circumstances in the comfort that there is a life beyond, victory over even the grave through our Lord Jesus Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's providence has the ordering of the period of our lives; our times are in His hand. The consideration of our inability to contend with God, of our sinfulness and weakness, should lead us to throw ourselves unreservedly into His hands that He might accomplish fully His purposes in us. 
Job 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Eliphaz's theory about Job, charging him with foolishly justifying himself. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, Eliphaz. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Unprofitable talk, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. Although God uses His saints, He places no confidence in them apart from the ability of the Holy Spirit which He imparts to them for service, and the standing they have in Jesus Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those speeches which do no good, being of no service either to God, our neighbors or ourselves, are better unspoken. If in our troubles we give ourselves to prayer and worship, we will be less apt to drop those expressions which cause others to question our sincerity and constancy in religion. 
Job 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job charges that Eliphaz is but heaping up words. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, three friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Miserable comforters, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 19, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. The best friend to plead for us is the Lord Jesus and it is the Holy Spirit through the Word, who comforts effectually. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is a great comfort to a good man who lies under the censures of brethren who do not understand his case, that there is a God in heaven who knows his integrity and sooner or later will clear it up. 
Job 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer continued. He longs for death. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Darkness, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. The believer has a surety with God, namely Christ, the heavenly intercessor. He will plead our cause if we look to Him and no one else can lay anything to our charge. (Rom. 8:32, 33). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer should recognize that wherever he goes there is but a step between him and the grave and should always be ready. However he should allow no hard providence to deter and discourage him in the service of God, but should be so much the more emboldened to persevere in God's way. 
Job 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Bildad's second discourse on Job's case. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Bildad, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - The wicked, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. It is not true that all who suffer great distresses in this world should, on that account, be judged wicked when no other proof appears against them. Christ's people are usually a suffering, cross-bearing people. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The way of sin is a way of fear and leads to everlasting confusion, of which the present terrors of conscience are but the earnest. 
Job 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer to Bildad. His sublime faith. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Hope, v. 27. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 25, 26, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Job had very clear beliefs. The brief statement here takes in redemption, assurance, second coming and resurrection. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We may easily bear the unjust reproaches of men if we live in expectation of the glorious appearance of the great God, our Saviour, and that we shall be made like Him when we see Him as He is. 
Job 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Zophar's second discourse on Job's case. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Zophar, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Portion of the wicked, v. 29. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. Men often mistake the dictates of passion for the dictates of reason and therefore think they are wise for expressing themselves. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Though wicked men may sometimes prosper, their joy is but for a moment and will quickly end in endless sorrow. 
Job 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer to Zophar in which he denies any secret sin. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, three friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prosperity (of wicked), v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 25. If we have eternal life through Jesus Christ, and spiritual blessings, we have no reason to complain of the little suffering we may be called upon to bear for Christ's sake in this world. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The providences of God in the government of this world are sometimes hard to be understood. When we cannot clearly account for the prosperity of the wicked and affliction of the godly, we should silently wait the issue, judging nothing before the time. 
Job 22:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Eliphaz's third discourse, accusing Job again of hypocrisy. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Eliphaz, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Wickedness, v. 5.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 16, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 5. Think it not strange, if like the Master, you are misunderstood and blackened, but learn to pass by accusations and commit your cause to Him who judgeth righteously. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is the duty of those especially who are in affliction to keep up a perfect acquaintance with God, accommodating themselves to all the disposals of His providence; thus they shall be possessed of His peace, no matter what the circumstances. 
Job 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job again answers. He longs for God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, three friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Tried, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. Though men do not, can not, or will not understand us, it is a comfort to know that our Lord Jesus, who was tried in all points as we are, does perfectly understand our hearts.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who keep the way of the Lord may comfort themselves with the thought that they are being tried, that the result will be for their honor and benefit and that when God is through with them they shall come forth as gold (1 Pet. 1:7) pure and precious to the Refiner. 
Job 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer continued. The prosperity of the wicked. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prosperity (of wicked). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 23. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Though wicked men seem sometimes to be under the special protection of divine providence, even dying without any disgrace, yet God keeps account of all their wickedness and will some day make it appear that their most secret sins, which they thought no eye saw, were under His eye and will be called over again.
Job 25:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Bildad's third discourse on Job's case. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Bildad, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Justification, v. 4. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. Since man, by reason of his fallen state and corrupt nature is odious to God's holiness, even in his best righteousness, we have need to be born again, that being justified by faith in Christ, we may have peace with God. Rom. 5:1.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Man cannot, in himself, be justified before God for he has no merit of his own to extenuate his guilt.
Job 26:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer to Bildad. His faith in God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - God's power, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. We are often disappointed in the counseling of our friends for they demand what we cannot produce and we need what they cannot give. Our Comforter, the Holy Spirit, never mistakes in His operations or misses in His ends. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God is infinite and incomprehensible; man's capacities to understand Him and all His ways are weak, therefore the full discovery of God's glory is reserved for the future state. Let us meanwhile be content with His revelations to us. 
Job 27:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer to Bildad continued. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Hypocrites, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - It is often the lot of upright men to be censured and condemned as hypocrites, but it well becomes them to bear up boldly under such censures, holding fast to Jesus Christ, who will keep from discouragement and eventually vindicate them. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The consideration of the miserable condition of the hypocrite should engage us to be upright. 
Job 28:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer continued. The value of divine wisdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Wisdom, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. There is truer satisfaction in the wisdom which God, through Christ, communicates to the Christian, showing the way to the joys of heaven, than in all the natural philosophies and sciences which only help men to find a way into the earth. (1-11).<br><b>Conclusion</b> - To be truly religious is to be truly wise. If we know God, His wisdom will appear in the practice and observance of our religion and we shall be surely guided in our way.
Job 29:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer continued. He rehearses the story of his life. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - The past, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - We can see in this chapter a familiar type of Christ in His power and goodness. Our Lord Jesus is the poor man's Lord, loving righteousness and hating iniquity. Upon Him the blessing of a world ready to perish comes. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - A gracious soul delights in God's smiles, not the smiles of the world, although virtue and piety challenge respect and usually have it. Those who are not only good, but DO GOOD are worthy of double honor.
Job 30:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer continued. He reviews his present condition. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Abhored, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Those who today cry "Hosannah" may tomorrow cry "Crucify." Job is here a type of Christ who was made the reproach of men and who hid not His face from shame and spitting. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The best saints often receive the worst of indignities from a spiteful and scornful world, merely because providence appears temporarily to be against them. Our Master Himself was thus abused, therefore we need not deem it strange. 
Job 31:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's answer continued. He insists on his integrity. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Integrity, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. The Lord Jesus keeps account of all and will bring every work into judgment. "If our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God."<br><b>Conclusion</b> - An upright heart does not dread a scrutiny. A good man is willing to know the worst of himself and will be thankful to those who will faithfully tell him of his faults.
Job 32:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Elihu's discourse, stating his reasons for interfering. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, Elihu, friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Opinions, vv. 6, 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Elihu shows a deeper spiritual conception than any of Job's three friends, because he has a higher conception of God. Externalists and moralizers, while they see God in His power through His works, know nothing of His grace toward man in Christ Jesus, but look upon Him as being very exacting in all His relations. He who has seen God in the cross of Calvary will have the highest conception of God.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - One who is jealous of the honor of God cannot be grieved when injury is plainly done. It is time to speak when we hear errors advanced and disputed for under pretense of supporting God's cause with them. (1 Tim. 4:12).
Job 33:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Elihu's discourse continued. Affliction is shown to be discipline. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Elihu, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - God's working, vv. 29, 30. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 26. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. "Ransom." Jesus Christ is our Ransom, the ransom of God's finding. So great was the injury done by sin, that nothing less could atone for it than the blood of the Son of God.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - God often afflicts the body in love and with gracious designs of good to the soul. Wherever God finds a submissive heart, He can do great things for the soul.
Job 34:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Elihu's discourse continued. He magnifies God's holiness.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Elihu, Job, friends. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Rebellious, v. 37. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10,21,32. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is absurd and unreasonable to multiply words in complaint against God's ways. His Fatherly corrections are a part of our filial education and we should beware of a rebellious heart which only brings added affliction to ourselves and reproach upon God.
Job 35:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Elihu's discourse continued. Job's rash talk reproved. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Elihu, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vanity, v. 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is vain to appeal to God to remove affliction, or to try to acquit ourselves, if we have not studied to know the end for which the affliction was sent. It is equally vain to pray for relief when we do not trust our case in God's hands. 
Job 36:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Elihu's discourse continued. God's justice defended. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Elihu, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - God's discipline, v. 22. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 22.<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 22. Trial is the school of trust. Sore distress is a blessing in disguise if it drives one to Christ and teaches the power of faith and prayer. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God does all things well. Though it may seem sometimes that we are neglected and forgotten and that providence has made an oversight, yet the tender eye of the heavenly Father is upon us, and when affliction has accomplished that for which it was sent, we shall be comforted and established. 
Job 37:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Elihu's discourse continued. God's majesty. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Elihu, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Majesty, vv. 14, 22. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14, 22, 23. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We must all own that our finite understandings cannot comprehend the infinite perfections of God, but we may be sure that because He is infinitely wise, He will do everything for the best. It therefore becomes us, in whatever circumstances, to reverence Him and patiently wait. 
Job 38:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - God's challenge to Job. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Challenge, v. 3. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. Man knows nothing about the making of this world other than what God has revealed in His Word. It is the honor of Jesus Christ that He was present when this was done. (Prov. 8:22; Jno. 1:1, 2). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who try to call God to account, will be called to account. Seeking to establish one's own character and darkening the counsels of God's wisdom, is an affront and provocation to God. Humble faith can know more of God's secrets than human reasonings. 
Job 39:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - God's challenge to Job continued. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Challenge, v. 1. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 28-30. The Lord Jesus referred to this instinct of the eagle in Matt. 24:28. See Rev. 19:17-18. Every creature will make toward that which is its proper food. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When we consider God's wonderful works in all nature about us, and see how wonderfully even the brute creatures are fitted for and inclined to the services for which they were designed, we see how unfit we are to dictate to God. Those who see God's hand in everything can best leave everything in His hands. 
Job 40:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - God's challenge to Job continued. Job's answer. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Challenge, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. God demands a quality no human being is able to present (not even perfect Job) but by His grace, through Jesus Christ, He bestows upon the yielded believer all that He asks. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - : A real vision of God's power and wisdom changes men's opinions of themselves and silences their disputes with God. The valley of humbling is a blessed place, for no one falls there who does not rise to newness of life and service. 
Job 41:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - God's challenge to Job concluded. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Challenge, v. 1. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. "Leviathan." There is a difference of opinion whether a crocodile or whale is meant here. In either case the great power of the Creator is illustrated.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Man is utterly unable to contend against the Almighty. If the inferior creatures keep man in awe, how wonderful must the majesty of God be, who has sovereign dominion over all.
Job 42:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Job's self- judgment, followed by new prosperity. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Job, Eliphaz, three friends. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - There can be no personal acquaintance with God until we have the sentence of death written upon self, realizing that in ourselves there is no good thing. All we are, we have by God's grace in our Lord Jesus Christ. The godly suffer that they might come to self-knowledge, 42:3; and self-judgment, 42:6; that they might repent, 42:6; and have greater fruitfulness, 42:7-17; and escape condemnation with the world. 1 Cor. 11:32.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Righteousness in a man is excellent but when one becomes too much aware of their own goodness, it reveals deep darkness as to their own real condition before God. If we really know God, we will be humble. If we really know ourselves, we cannot be proud. 
Psa 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The two ways of man. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, righteous man, ungodly man. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Godly and ungodly, vv. 1, 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3.<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Our Lord Jesus was the typical "blessed man" who delighted to do the Father's will.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Blessed is the man whose footsteps are ordered by the Word of God for he shall find both peace and prosperity. Those who are without God are being hurried to a terrible doom.
Psa 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The psalm of the king; rejected, established and finally reigning. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, kings of earth. <br><b>Key Word</b> - God's King, v. 6.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. The yoke of Christ is intolerable to a graceless neck but to the sinner, saved by His precious blood, it is easy and light. Matt. 11:29. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The kings of earth are ever setting themselves in array against God and His Annointed King, but in the day when He conies those who will not bend will be broken. Infinitely wise is he who yields his life to Jesus now and dreadful is the folly of those who continue in enmity to Him.
Psa 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - A prayer of David (when he fled from Absalom). <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sustained, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 5, 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - In many of the psalms of David, we can see more of David's Lord than of David himself. The agonies of Christ are wonderfully portrayed in this chapter. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God is a shield for His trusting people. He wards off the fiery darts of Satan and the storms of trouble, at the same time speaking peace to the tempest within the breast. 
Psa 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David's exhortation to others to serve God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Godliness, v. 3.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 5. Let the sinner flee to the sacrifice of Calvary and there put his whole trust, for He who died was none other than the Lord Jehovah.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The godly are chosen, and by distinguished grace set apart and separated from men, all the longings of the soul being satisfied in God. How rash are they, who by rejecting Christ, hate their own mercies merely that they might discover the vanities of sin.
Psa 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David's prayer in which he extols God's holiness and asks judgment upon the wicked. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prayer, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 11, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. (Worship toward the temple.) The temple shadowed forth the body of Christ, our Mediator, in whom alone our prayers are accepted with the Father. In our praying the soul should ever look toward Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Prayer should be both the key of the morning and the bolt of the evening. If we pledge ourselves to Him at the beginning of day, taking sides with Him against the things He abhors, we will be apt to find His way straight before our faces throughout the day. 
Psa 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David in weakness seeks God's help. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sore vexed, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. In this psalm of sorrow, David is seen as a type of Christ who wept and cried out "My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death," but found strength to sustain in the Father above. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Our way often lies through a vale of tears, but there is One whom we can trust in the greatest straits and difficulties and who can dry our tears and stop our pains. To Him let us betake ourselves waiting upon Him in earnest prayer. 
Psa 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - David prays for deliverance from persecutors. ' <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Persecutors, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10, 16. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When the believer is slandered he has the court of heaven to fly to and a righteous Judge who is the patron of oppressed innocency. He will be our defense and will return upon the wicked their shame. Self vindication is not judicious or serviceable.

For a little time He was made lower than angels, when He took upon Himself the form of a servant. All creatures are under His feet and will eventually own Him to be Lord of all. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When we consider the majesty of God's wonderful works in the universe, we cannot but wonder that He should notice such a mean creature as man, yet we may be sure he takes precedence of all the inhabitants of this world, being made but a little lower than angels.

Some see in the seven-fold trying of God's Word, an allusion to the seven dispensations of man or to the seven periods of the church, or to that perfection signified in the number seven to which the Scriptures will have been brought at the Revelation of Jesus Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer is commonly tempted to think that because trouble has lasted long, it will last always, but if he will bring his cares and griefs to the throne of grace, he may go away with praise, being assured that all will be well at last. 
Psa 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prayer for deliverance from enemies. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Supplication, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - If, after all our pains, we find Jesus Christ in a new way, it will make full amends for all our long patience. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer's desires often turn to impatience, for days seem long when the soul is cast down, but because God's face is hidden, it does not follow that His heart has forgotten. If we hold to God by faith, we will at the same time be assured that victory is coming and that, after all, God has dealt bountifully with us.

He who in soul and body was- preeminently God's Holy One was loosed from the pains of death because it was not possible that He should be holden of it. (vv. 8-10.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who commit themselves to God's care and submit themselves to God's guidance will find a blessed portion in Him. If we have the pleasures of His favor, we should not fail to give Him the praise of it.

In the prospect of awaking with His likeness, we can cheerfully waive the enjoyments of this life and suffer with patience.

The book of nature (vv. 1-6) is read by every human being. The book of the law (vv. 7-14) converts the soul and becomes an unfailing guide. The book of human life (vv. 12-14) is a Bible to the unsaved world and must therefore be maintained with unspotted pages.

We must by experience know the value of the blood shed on Calvary's cross and see the sword awakened against the Shepherd before we can truly know the sweetness of the Good Shepherd's care. Psa. 22 is the Good Shepherd dying for His sheep. (Jno. 10:11.) Psa. 23 is the Great Shepherd caring for His sheep. (Heb. 13:20.) Psa. 24 is the Chief Shepherd coming again for His sheep. (1 Pet. 5:4.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jehovah is with (v. 1) under (v. 2) beside (v. 2) after (v. 6) before (v. 5) and ahead of (v. 6) all His trusting children. They shall not want for food (v. 2) drink (v. 2) strength (v. 3) guidance (v. 3) comfort (v. 4) satisfaction (v. 5) or life (v. 6).

Good and upright. God's goodness and uprightness are in perfect union. They were perfectly blended in the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus on Calvary.

Faith in this sacrifice is the sinner's only hope of being delivered. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is our duty and privilege to trustingly wait upon the Lord in adoration, supplication and service all the days of our lives. Those whose hearts are right with Him, shall not err for want of heavenly direction in any time of perplexity.

We get here a picture of Christ against whom false witnesses arose, breathing out cruelty, but though He was delivered into their wicked hands, He was not delivered to their wills, for God exalted Him far above all principality and power. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God is the believer's light and strength by whom and in whom he lives. We should therefore let the heart be fixed in Him and the mind stayed upon Him, waiting His deliverance in all circumstances.

The Lord Jesus is able to bring substantial consolation to the believer. He Himself was for a time deserted of the Father that those who believe on Him might not be deserted eternally. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We should hem all our blessings with praise lest they unravel. Let us never forget to pray, nor ever doubt the success of prayer.

The righteousness of Christ being imputed to the believer and the believer being made the righteousness of God "in Him"his iniquity is not set to his account. Christ took upon Himself the iniquity of us all and was made sin for us.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - The only cover that will hide our sins forever away from God's sight is that provided in the atoning death of His Son. He is blessed indeed who has a Substitute who assumes all accounts to stand for him. If the believer does not humble himself by the confession of his sins to God, God will humble him by chastisements.
Psa 33:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Praise of God's wisdom and power. <br><b>Characters</b> - Psalmist, God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Praise, v, 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 10, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 6. The three persons of the Godhead united in the creation of all things. Christ is the Word, (Jno. 1:1) without whom nothing was made. The Holy Spirit is the breath. God made the world, as He rules it and redeems it, by His Son and Spirit. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The righteous who know the goodness of God should never be empty of His praises.

Although it is strange that we meet with anything of Christ here, this Scripture is said to have been fulfilled in Christ. Jno. 19:36. The passover lamb of which not a bone was broken prefigured Jesus and at the same time the complete keeping of His Body, the Church. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's people who share His special favor should concur in His praises and magnify His name together.

If we are falsely charged, let us remember that so persecuted they the prophets and our Lord Himself. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The most righteous men and the most righteous causes may expect to meet with many mighty and malicious enemies. The safest place to leave a righteous cause is with the righteous God who is able to give judgment upon it in the right way and at the right time. If God is our friend, it does not matter who our enemies are. 
Psa 36:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The wicked contrasted with the righteous and the Lord of devout men extolled.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Wicked, v. 1 (satisfaction, v. 8). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 8, 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 9.

We cannot see Jesus by the light of self, but we see self in the light of Jesus.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Sinners are self destroyers and when sin is finally made to appear in its true colors to them, they will be made a terror to themselves. But whatever is amiss with the world, we may be sure there is nothing amiss with Jehovah and that those who cleave closely to Him shall be eternally satisfied.
Psa 37:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The riddle of the prosperity of the wicked and the affliction of the righteous.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Evil doers, v. 1, and righteous, v. 37. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - I, 3, 4, 5, 7, 16, 23, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Come what may, the saints are safe in Christ Jesus and because He lives, they shall live also.

Who would not be a Christian on such terms, in spite of all the oppression of the godless? <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer should never waste a minute fretting about his enemies, but should look forward with the eye of faith, when he will see no reason to envy wicked people their short-lived prosperity.

This is the condition of every awakened conscience until given relief through the Lord Jesus. When man sees himself in the light of God's Word applied by the Spirit, he must acknowledge his depravity and helplessness to get deliverance apart from Jesus Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God often contends with His children to awaken their consciences and to set their sins in order before them for their humiliation. If we are truly penitent for sin, we will make a particular acknowledgment of what we have done amiss and God will then restore the joy of salvation, with patience to bear our affliction. 
Psa 39:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The psalmist, bowed down with sorrow and sickness, is burdened with unbelieving thoughts and prays for help. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sorrow, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We should not feed the fire of discontent by poring over our troubles, for we cannot, with all our disquietment, altar the nature of things. Although satisfaction is not to be found at all in the creature, it is always to be found in God, and to Him we should be drawn by our disappointments.

The offerings had their worth only as types of the sacrifice of Christ, but when He came, as it was foretold in the volume of the Book, they ceased to be of worth. He alone completely did the will of God. Our expiation from sin is due not to us, but our Substitute's obedience to the will of Jehovah.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who seek God in all their perplexities shall rejoice and be glad in Him, for He will not only be found of them, but will be their bountiful rewarder, wherefore, they should say continually, "the Lord be magnified."

Our Lord Jesus, for our sakes, was overwhelmed with a deluge of grief, like that of the old world, when the fountains of the deep were broken up. He endured all the billows of God's wrath against sin. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God often teaches His saints effectually to know the worth of His mercies by causing them to feel the want of them. A believing confidence in God is the best antidote against disquietude of spirit. The way to forget our miseries is to rest in the God of our mercies.

There is a reference here to those who suffer, even unto death, for the testimony of Christ and to whom it is applied in Rom. 8:36. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The tokens of God's displeasure are more grievous to those who have been long accustomed to the tokens of His favor, but the remembrance of His former goodness should be a cause of heart searching and a support to faith.

How much more worthy is He of our love.

God the Father is a river (Jer. 2:13). God the Son is a river, the fountain of salvation (Zech. 13:1, 3). God the Spirit is a river (Jno. 7:38; 4:14). The perfections of the Father, the fullness of Christ, the operations of the Holy Spirit these make up the great river that makes glad the city of God. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's people may count themselves safe and make themselves strong in Him in whom there is always help sufficient, no matter what is the case and exigence.

Christ has done that for us which all the wealth of the world cannot do, redeeming us with His precious blood (1 Pet. 1:18-19). The redemption of the soul is precious because of its tremendous cost. Having been once wrought, it ceases forever, never needing to be repeated. (Heb. 9:25-26; 10:12.)<br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is no security in the possession and enjoyment of wealth, for money cannot buy the redemption of the soul. God's children, though poor, are truly happy above the most prosperous of this world because they are guarded against the terrors of death and judgment to come.

In that great day, He will make those to hear judgment who would not hearken to His calls in Grace. Those only will be gathered to God who have sincerely covenanted with Him through the sacrifice of His Son.

The sinner is purged by blood upon acceptance of Christ (Heb. 1:3; 9:12; 10:14) which takes away the guilt of sin.

(Eph. 5:25-26.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All the believer's wrong doing comes to a climax at the foot of the throne, being violation of God's law. While the penalty of sin has been blotted out by the blood, the defilement of all subsequent sin remains. Confession brings sin out of its hiding place and enables the sinner to take sides with God against it. See 1 Jno. 1:9.

The persecutors of our Lord Jesus are compared to dogs (22:16). They ran Him down with barking, for otherwise they could have found no way to take Him. What they lacked in reason and justice, they made up in noise.<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who are for Christ's sake, harmless and innocent may expect to be hated of wicked men. It is their wisdom and duty in times of such difficulties, to wait upon God, for He is their defense, their refuge in whom they shall be safe.

Christ bore up the pillars and saved the world from utter ruin by saving His people from their sins. "He upholds all things by the word of His power." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - A word from God soon abases the lofty, and hence failure to reckon on God is madness.

Those who desire God to avenge them must themselves be upon praying ground. 
Psa 80:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The tokens of God's favor besought and the former blessings cited as a basis for present deliverance. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Asaph. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Turn us again, vv. 3, 7, 14, 19. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 17.

When He comes, all unrighteous potentates will be broken like potter's vessels. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God judges among the mighty of earth. They have their power from Him and are accountable to Him. Magistrates should therefore do good with all their power, remembering that it is their special office and duty to protect and deliver the poor. .

In Christ the attributes of God meet in perfect unity in the salvation of guilty men by a holy and righteous God. By the gift of Calvary, God is as true as if He had fulfilled every letter of His threatenings and as righteous as if He had never spoken peace to a guilty sinner. Christ, our perfect Substitute, has taken the full penalty of our sins. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The sense of present affliction should not be allowed to drown the remembrance of former mercies, but should rather cause us to recall them with praise, and encourage us to look for grace and mercy in reference to present distress.

Zion may be taken as a type of the Gospel church of which even more glorious things are spoken than of Jerusalem. It is the Bride of Christ, a peculiar people, a royal priesthood, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. We need never be ashamed of the church, even in its meanest condition. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God has expressed a particular affection for Jerusalem because there He met and conversed with His people and showed them the great tokens of His favor. Because His love is set upon it, His people also should hold it in reverent regard.

It is God who has gathered the winds in His fists and His name is "I am that I am" (Ex. 3:14), a name to be adored, not to be understood. He has a Son, Jesus Christ, whose name was to be called "Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, Prince of Peace." By Him, God made all that was made, and by Him He controls all things. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's Word is sure and pure, and venturing our souls upon it, we shall find it a shield against temptations, a safe protection in the midst of greatest dangers.

The things of earth are passing away and hence are vanity if they be trusted in. There is a kingdom coming in which believers shall inherit substance and where there is no vanity. Matt. 11:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:19. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All things, considered as abstract from God, and apart from Him, all worldly employments and enjoyments, are vanity of vanities, and if there were no supernatural method of giving peace to the heart and another life to follow, were indeed made in vain. 
Ecc 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Solomon shows that there is no true happiness and satisfaction to be had in mirth, pleasure and the delights of sense. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vanity, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 26. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - True and lasting happiness and satisfaction consist not in mirth, the gratifying of appetites, the spending of money or the getting of wisdom. Only he who sets God always before him and employs himself for God may find heart rest in this world and that joy which He alone can give. 
Ecc 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The mutability of all human affairs and the unchangeableness and unsearchableness of the divine counsels. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Man's portion, v. 22. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 14, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 17. In the midst of all the inequalities of human affairs it is a great comfort to know that the eye of faith can see that Jesus Christ, the Judge, stands before the door and that when He comes, He will reward the righteous and punish the pride and cruelty of oppressors. Though the day of affliction may seem long, we may patiently wait His coming, when there will be an examination into every purpose and every work done under the sun. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We live in a world of changes. The events of time and the conditions of human life are continually passing and repassing, yet every change is determined by the supreme power and we should therefore accommodate ourselves to His purposes. The only true pleasure of life is in making good use of the things God has given us, making ourselves serviceable to those about us. 
Ecc 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Discontent and impatience because of the oppressions and iniquities of life. <br><b>Characters</b> - Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vanity, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. For every right work, the Christian is remembered by the Lord Jesus, and at His coming will be rewarded. Though he be hated by a neighbor for a right work, the Christian will always be abounding in the work of the Lord knowing his labor will not be in vain in the Lord. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The world is full of trouble. By reason of man's perversity, he is ever disturbed and perplexed by social conditions around him. If Christ and the hope of heaven were not taken into account, to die as soon as possible would be desirable.

The vanity and vexation attending the possession of wealth. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vanity, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Those who labor only for the world, to fill their hands with that which they cannot take away, will not only die an uncomfortable death, but will miss the only satisfaction of life. (v. 12.) The sleep of the diligent Christian is sweet, for having spent his strength and time in Christ's service, he can cheerfully return to Him and repose in Him who gives rest. Matt. 11:28-29. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We should address ourselves to the worship of God with all possible seriousness and care, for religious exercises if not rightly directed, may become empty ceremony, and we will miss our end in coming into His presence. 
Ecc 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The vanity of worldly wealth as pertaining only to the body. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vanity, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. Those who have ever so much, yet do not know Christ, are ever craving. Wealth to a worldling is like drink to one who has dropsy, which only increases the thirst. Christ is the true Bread which satisfies; the Water of life which quenches all thirst of the soul. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Man deprives himself of the good he might have had of his worldly possessions by not consecrating them to God. If one does not have the will to serve God with what he has, God may deny him the power to even serve himself with it. 
Ecc 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prudence recommended as a means of avoiding much of the vanitj and vexation of the world. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Wisdom, vv. 11, 19. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9,29. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The best way to save ourselves from the vexation which the vanity of the world creates, is to make use of wisdom, maintaining strict government of the passions. Wisdom is a defense (v. 12).
Ecc 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Wisdom recommended as an antidote against the temptations and vexations arising from the vanity of the world. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Wisdom, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 12. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Heavenly wisdom makes a man a good man, emboldening him against his adversaries, their attempts and their scorn. It teaches him that sentence is passed by a righteous Judge against all evil works, even though the execution of sentence is long delayed, and that it shall be well in the end with those who fear God. 
Ecc 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The universality of death and the need of minding the business of life and using wisdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vanity, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. Regardless of how the outward condition of men may seem to us, let it be remembered that all men's affairs are in God's hand and that prosperity is not necessarily a sign of God's love or affliction of His hatred. If a man has Christ as His Savior, he may be happy though the world frowns upon him, and if he is without Christ, he may be miserable, though the world smiles upon him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - While there is life there is opportunity of preparing for death, and since death is certain, it is our wisdom to make the best possible use of life while it lasts, cheerfully taking our share of life's enjoyments, applying ourselves diligently to life's business, and being governed by divine wisdom in all its affairs. 
Ecc 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Proverbs recommending wisdom as of great use for the right ordering of our lives. <br><b>Characters</b> - Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Wisdom and folly, vv. 6, 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. Those who profess to be followers of Christ, who is said to be "made unto us wisdom," have need to walk very circumspectly lest they be guilty of any instance of folly, for many eyes are upon them. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Fools are apt, at every turn, to proclaim their folly, for if one is lacking in true wisdom, it cannot be concealed. True wisdom is true honor and will gain a man a reputation which is very valuable. 
Ecc 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Exhortation to works of charity and right living. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Give, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 9. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Since we have death and judgment to prepare for, we should do good to others and abound in liberality to the poor, which will (if we are in Christ) abound to our account.
Ecc 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Exhortation to the young to be religious. The vanity of the world. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Solomon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fear God, v. 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 13, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 13. This is on the ground of law, not grace. To fear God and keep the commandments is the best that man, apart from redemption, can do. The Christian, under the Gospel, has Christ living in Him (Gal. 2:20) and his body is a shrine of the Holy Ghost (1 Cor. 6:19). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The great antidote against the diseases of youth, the love of mirth, the indulgence of sensual pleasures, and the vanities to which youth is subject, is the reverence of God reigning in the heart and a respect to His commandments. To reverence God is the summary of religion.

Solomon is used as an illustrious type of Christ because of his wisdom and wealth and the fact that he built the temple. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who are truly of the Bride, will evince the sincerity of their love to Christ by continual and solicitous enquiries after Him and will not be satisfied until Christ Himself is apprehended by faith.

All the beauty of saints is derived from Him.
Son 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The distress of the Bride because of the temporary withdrawal of the groom, due to the Bride's neglect. <br><b>Characters</b> - Solomon, Bride (Christ, Church). <br><b>Key Word</b> - Beloved withdrawn, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 6. Rev. 3:20 describes the state of the Church in coldness toward Christ. He has knocked for entrance, but in their drowsiness and coldness, they have not responded. They find themselves at last deserted by Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The slights which careless souls put upon Christ are grievous to Him and He suspends the communication of His comfort to those who are remiss and drowsy in His service. The loss of the sense of His presence is a matter of great grief to the believer.

In answer to the expressions of Christ's regard for His own, the believer should triumph in his relation to Him and rejoice in the hold He has of him. 
Son 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The affections between the Bridegroom and His Bride. <br><b>Characters</b> - Solomon, Bride (Christ, Church). <br><b>Key Word</b> - Love, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14.

The ceremonial observances were all done away by the death of Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The backslidings of those who have professed relations to God are very provoking to Him and all departures from Him and opposition to Him are aggravated by the constant manifestation of His goodness and mercy toward the backslider. Those who will break off their allegiance with sin are always welcome to come back to fellowship with Him.

The humbling of the haughty and the shame of sinners in that day. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Isaiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Last days, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 19-21. Rev. 6:12-17 shows that the reference here is to the time of Christ's return to judge in terrible majesty. Those who do not flee to Christ before that day will flee from Him then. The prophecy of this chapter relates entirely to Christ's kingdom, still future, when once more the laws of God shall go forth out of Zion. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In view of the terribleness of that day when Christ shall come to shake the earth and to judge among men, we should shun the ways of sin. In view of the privilege the righteous have of sharing in His universal Kingdom, we should seek to walk in the light of the Lord all our days.

Some believe Christ thought these words when He beheld Jerusalem and wept over it (Luke 19:41), and had reference to it in the parable of the vineyard. Matt. 21:33. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God expects vineyard fruit from those who enjoy vineyard privileges, not the mere leaves of profession, or the wild grapes of hypocritical performances in religion. God will deny His grace to those who have long received it in vain. The curse of barrenness is the punishment of the sin of barrenness.

However in the deluge of trouble that may come to a nation, God will keep the heads of His trusting people above water, if they will make His statutes, rather than those having familiar spirits, their counsellors.

The rod of the wicked shall be broken, and Satan and all his followers shall be cast into hell.

Isa 28:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Woe of Ephriam due to drunkenness. Prediction of Assyrian captivity of Ephriam. Ephriam's fate a warning to Judah. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Woe, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 16. This is expressly applied to Christ in the N. T., 1 Pet. 2:6-8. He is that stone which has become the head of the corner. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The glorious beauty and the plenty of the land is but a fading flower to those who indulge themselves in sensuality and drunkenness. God will throw it to the ground to be broken in pieces with a hand they are powerless to oppose and will not suffer either His providences or His ordinances to be brought into utter contempt. 
Isa 29:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Warnings to Judah and Jerusalem of impending discipline.

Isa 30:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Warnings against alliance with Egypt against Sennacherib and exhortation to turn to the Lord for help. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Pharoah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Shame and confusion, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 18. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When sin has brought men into distress, it is their wisdom, in repentance, to turn to God for deliverance, but those who think to prosper in their sin, by the help of man, add sin to sin and invite worse disaster upon themselves. If we would be saved from the evil of every calamity and secured from the curse of it, we should turn to Jehovah and repose in Him. 
Isa 31:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Judah again warned against the Egyptian alliance. Jehovah's defense of Jerusalem. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Trust in man, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1<br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is gross absurdity to forsake the Rock of Ages for broken reeds. If men will not court God's wisdom and power to act for them in the time of danger, they will find it to act against them, though they have the strongest of men to aid them. Make not man your confidence, for man can do nothing without God. 
Isa 32:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Promise of coming Kingdom. Warning of great tribulation. The King Deliverer. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Tribulation and kingdom, vv. 10-15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 17, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. This Scripture certainly looks forward to the Day of the Lord (2:10-22; Rev. 19:11-21) and the Kingdom blessing to follow when Christ shall return to reign. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Wasting and desolating judgment upon the land and people of Israel was pronounced because they lived in pleasure and wanton, ignoring God's commands, and all who set their hearts upon the world will meet like wretched disappointment. It is the comfort of the faithful few that blessed times of righteousness and eternal rest are promised when the Prince of Peace shall come forth to reign. 
Isa 33:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The distress of Judah and Jerusalem because of coming woes. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgment, v. 5 <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 15, 16, 17, 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 17. Those who walk uprightly shall not only be preserved through the judgments that visit mankind upon the earth, but shall with the eye of faith, ever see the King in His beauty, and shall at last stand in His presence, when His beauty shall be upon them. 1 John 3:2. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The righteous God pays sinners in their own coin. When they have filled up the measure of their iniquity, God will begin, for the sinner's day is sure to come. The godly man's comfort is that he shall,

It is Christ who will come in the clouds of heaven to execute judgment, and out of whose mouth goes a sharp sword, as He judges and makes war upon the nations. Rev. 19:11, 15. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is a day fixed in the divine counsels for the deliverance of God's people and cause in the earth and the destruction of all enemies a year of recompense for the controversy of Zion. Those who make the Book of the Lord their meditation and rule of life, will have complete deliverance from the coming judgment of nations (v. 16).

Vengeance will then be taken on the powers of darkness and recompense will be made to the saints for all injuries and losses. All the earth shall break forth in beauty and great wonders will be wrought among men. 
Isa 36:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sennacherib's invasion and Jehovah's deliverance. The threats of Rabshakeh.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Sennacherib, Rabskakeh, Hezekiah, Eliakim, Shebnab, Joab, Pharaoh.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Confidence unshaken, vv. 4, 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 21. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The enemies of God's people are ever trying to frighten them from their confidence in God. That we may keep our ground against the enemies of our souls, it concerns us to keep a firm hope in God that we may not lose spirit in the day of trial.
Isa 37:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's message to the people by Isaiah. Sennacherib's message to Hezekiah. Hezekiah's prayer and Jehovah's answer.

When dangers are most pressing, it is fitting that prayer should be most lively, for God will be a defense to those who truly look to Him. 
Isa 38:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Hezekiah's sickness and recovery in answer to prayer.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Isaiah, Hezekiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Healing, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Some think that in turning his face toward the wall, he was turning, as was customary, toward the temple, which was a type of Christ. To Him we must look, by faith, in every prayer. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Neither men's greatness nor goodness will exempt them from the arrests of sickness. If one is sick, let him pray (Jas. 5:13) for God's love is sufficient to bring one from the very pit of corruption, if it be His will. Those whose life is as from the dead are in a special manner obliged to praise God all their days. 
Isa 39:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Hezekiah's folly. Babylonian captivity of Judah foretold. <br><b>Characters</b> - Isaiah, Merodach-baladan, Hezekiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Impending captivity v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is folly for one whom God has dignified to be overproud of the respect paid him by unbelieving princes. We have need to watch our own spirits when showing another what we have done and what we have gotten, as if our own merit had secured it. God will take that from us on which we build a carnal confidence.

Reproof for their despondencies. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Isaiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Comfort, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 8, 11, 26, 28, 29, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 11. Christ is the Good Shepherd. John 10:11. He has a special care for the lambs that are weak and cannot help themselves, gathering them into the arms of His power and carrying them in the bosom of His love. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Nothing can be spoken more comforting to those who realize themselves undone, than the coming of the Redeemer as the Lamb of God and as the Good Shepherd. Those who are ready to acknowledge they have no might, may wait upon Him, for He will be their help if they will humbly depend on Him. 
Isa 41:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Greatness of God and weakness of man. Admonition to shun idols and encouragement to trust in God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Jacob. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fear not, vv. 10, 13, 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 13, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. Christ is the Redeemer and the Holy One of Israel, engaged by promise of God's people. In Him is help found, therefore let Him be worshiped in the beauty of holiness. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jehovah is infinite, eternal and unchangeable. He has governed the world from the beginning and will until the end of time. Let the believer therefore depend upon Him as the God sufficient for him in the worst of times. He would not have His people to be a timorous people, for His grace can silence fears, even when there is the greatest cause for them. 
Isa 42:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christ, servant of Jehovah. Chastening of Israel and the final restoration. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgment, vv. 1, 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 4. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 1-7. Fulfilled in Christ (Matt. 12:17-21). Note the twofold account of the coming servant. 1. As weak, despised, rejected and slain. 2. As mighty conqueror taking vengeance. The former class of passages were fulfilled in the first advent. The second await His return for fulfillment. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - A day is coming when all who have contradicted and blasphemed the Gospel of Christ shall be put to silence and shame, and when all the oppositions of the powers of darkness shall be thrown down. Let the believer therefore delight in Christ, rely upon Him and rejoice in Him, for all who are "in Him" will be well-pleasing to God. 
Isa 43:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The chosen nation redeemed and restored. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Gathered, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 10, 11, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Christ, the Great Redeemer, will appear for Israel (Rom. 11:25). At His coming, the spiritual seed of Israel (through the Gospel of grace) will be gathered to heaven as their home and given glorified bodies. Believers under the Gospel are the Bride of Christ who will "reign with Him" in His coming Kingdom on earth. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Israel is God's peculiar people, distinguished from all others, and having the promise that they shall never be absorbed and that nations shall be sacrificed to their welfare. They will be finally gathered from all the earth to their own land, and when Christ shall appear as King of Kings, their sins will be blotted out, and they shall be restored to full favor. 
Isa 44:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The promise of the Spirit and the coming restoration. The folly of idolatry.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Cyrus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Ashamed, restored (vv. 11, 22, 26). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 8, 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 23-27. When Christ returns and is received by Israel, their idolatry and sin will be remembered no more, and recognizing Him whom they pierced, they will be restored to a place of great fruitfulness. (Rom. 11:25.)<br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is no God besides Jehovah. He is infinite and therefore there can be no other. He is sufficient, and therefore no other is needed. It is foolishness to expect any good from gods of man's own making and only the blind and ignorant can look to graven images.
Isa 45:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Promises to Cyrus for Israel's sake. Proof of God's eternal power and sovereignty. Encouragement to believing Jews. Doom of idol worshippers. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Cyrus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah omnipotent. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 18, 22, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 22. This verse has a further reference to the conversion of the Gentiles that live in the ends of the earth through the lifting up of Christ on Calvary's Cross. As the stung Israelites looked to the brazen serpent, so all were invited to look to Christ and be saved. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Beside Jehovah there is no God. He alone is self-existent, selfsufficient, being infinite and eternal. Those are in woeful condition who strive with their Maker and give honor to images which cannot give good. Those who trust in God will never be made ashamed of their confidence in Him. 
Isa 46:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Israel exhorted to remember the power of God and powerlessness of idols. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Remember, vv. 8-9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 12-13. This may be applied to the Jews in their rejection of Christ, for they thought to establish their own righteousness, and would not accept the righteousness of God in Christ, by faith. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - False gods will certainly fail the worshippers when they have most need of them. It is absurd to think of making any creature equal with the Creator, who is infinitely above all He has created. Let all remember that they have been the constant care of His kind providence and are absolutely dependent upon Him. 
Isa 47:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Judgment pronounced upon Babylon. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Vengeance, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. Christ is the Great Redeemer, who as the Holy One of Israel saves His people, and as Lord of Hosts will take vengeance upon the wicked. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who abuse their honor or power provoke God to deprive them of it utterly and to make them sit in dust. While God often makes use of evil men for the correction of His people, He always breaks the rod of His wrath because of their boastfulness and cruelty. 
Isa 48:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The dullness of Israel. Restoration under the Servant of Jehovah. Israel reminded of the promises. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Anger deferred, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 17, 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 16-17. The Spirit of God is here spoken of as a person distinct from Father and Son, as that which is said to the same 'purpose with this (61:1) is applied to Christ (Luke 4:21), so may this be. Christ the Redeemer was sent by the Father and He had the Spirit without measure. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God often finds His people obstinate and perverse, but for all that He makes it redound to the honor of His mercy to spare and reprieve them, refining them in the furnace of affliction, rather than cutting them off. O, that men would own Him as the true and only God, receiving His promises and looking to His Redeemer. 
Isa 49:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Israel's coming Redeemer. Preservation and restoration of Israel and judgment on oppressors. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Redeemer, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. Christ was the Redeemer .who was despised and rejected of men, and abhorred by nations, who cried "crucify Him." But God promised Him exaltation in the depths of His humiliation, and at His return He will be acknowledged King of Kings and Lord of Lords. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God, of old, promised a Redeemer to His people who would also become a Light to the Gentiles. Through Him, the souls of those looking to Him were to be set free from the bondage of guilt and corruption; His own should be wonderfully provided for, and through Him, at length, Israel would be restored and the earth established in righteousness, peace and joy. 
Isa 50:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The humiliation of the Holy One of Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Smitten Redeemer, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7., 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. Here we see Jesus in Creative power; v. 4 as the dependent teacher; v. 5 as the faithful servant; v. 6 as the patient sufferer; v. 8 as the justified Redeemer. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Lord Jesus, our Redeemer, was to be wise above all men, able to speak the word of comfort to every heart; He was to have the ear of the learned to receive instruction in all things from His Father. In spite of this, He was to be smitten and insulted by men, yet unshaken in constancy and resolution, suffering all patiently and voluntarily for the salvation of the world. Let all who fear God, build their hopes upon Christ who has proven Himself the Savior of mankind. 
Isa 51:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Final redemption of Israel and punishment of oppressors. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Zion's comfort, vv. 3, 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 7, 12, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 5. Christ brought an everlasting righteousness and salvation. Those whose happiness is bound up in His righteousness, will have the comfort of it eternally. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Although God's people are called upon to suffer much upon earth, they have an eternal cause to rejoice, in that all who trust in His salvation have the approbation of the living God and may therefore despise the censures of dying men who will shortly be punished. 
Isa 52:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of Jerusalem in the Kingdom age. Jehovah's servant marred and afterward exalted. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jerusalem redeemed, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 11, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 7, 14. v. 7 has an application to the preaching of the Gospel, a message indeed of good news and victory over spiritual enemies (Rom. 10:15). v. 14 points plainly at Jesus (Acts 8:34-35). Never was man so barbarously treated as was the Son of God. When He returns in glory the kings of the earth shall shut their mouths at Him, and the Jews will look with mourning upon Him whom they pierced. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let God's people prepare for eternal joy, for His Word shall without tail have its accomplishment in due season. Jerusalem shall be made a praise and all the earth shall break forth in joy when He who was rejected and despised of men shall come forth 'as Lord and King. 
Isa 53:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The vicarious sacrifice of Christ, the servant of Jehovah. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Man of sorrows, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Christ rose in the world as a tender plant. The greater part of those among whom He lived saw none of His beauty. Because He announced Himself as the Savior of the world, He was abandoned and abhorred. Nevertheless God highly exalted Him, and He appears in heaven to make intercession for all who accept His sacrifice. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - .The whole race of mankind lies under the stain of original corruption, all gone astray from God. God, in love sent His only begotten Son into the world, who voluntarily made Himself an offering for sin. He submitted Himself to the disgraces and afflictions due to the worst of men, that those who should believe on Him, might have the joy and glory due to Him as the one perfect man. 
Isa 54:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Israel as the restored wife of Jehovah in the Kingdom age. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Restored Israel, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - As Israel is spoken of as the wife of Jehovah, so the church of the present dispensation is called "the bride of Christ" (the Lamb). However this chapter has wholly to do with the fulfillment of God's covenant with Israel. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We may with greatest assurance depend upon God for the keeping of His covenant with His people (especially Israel) for He will not keep His anger against them forever, but will gather them out of their dispersions that they may return in a body to their land, where He will again be a husband to them. 
Isa 55:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's everlasting salvation. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Come, vv. 1, 3, 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 4, 5. Christ was given to the world for a witness of God's love and mercy (John 3:16). He is the true leader and commander to show man what to do and enable him to do it. Through Him the door was opened to the Gentile nations to enter into God's eternal salvation. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All are invited to partake of God's salvation provided through Christ. All the world's wealth and pleasure cannot satisfy the soul, but God's eternal salvation brings true life and peace. It is man's wisdom, therefore, to seek Christ while He may be found, forsaking sin and dislodging all preconceived notions contrary to God's truth, for God will then abundantly pardon. 
Isa 56:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Solemn instruction given to all to make conscience of duty. Charge against the careless and unfaithful. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Justice and righteousness, vv. 1, 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. The great salvation announced and wrought out by Christ was preceded by the call to repentance and faith. In Christ, the righteousness of God was revealed (Rom. 1:17) and he is "made righteousness" unto all who receive Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The more assurance God gives us of the performance of His promises, the stronger obligations He lays us under to obedience to His commands. Righteousness and justice on our part, are required to evidence the security of our faith and repentance, and to open the way of mercy. 
Isa 57:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Further ethical instructions. Sins of the people denounced. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Wicked, v. 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 21. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God is justly displeased when the voice of His rod is not heard, much more, when sin and idolatry are knowingly rejoiced in. Sinners shall find no quietness or satisfaction in their own hearts and will be made to feel the full force of His anger if sin is not repented of and forsaken. 
Isa 58:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Hypocritical professions of religion. Instructions how to keep fasts aright. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Hypocritical fasts, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7, 10, 11. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is common for unhumbled hearts, while they perform the external services of religion, to promise themselves acceptance with God, which He has promised only to the sincere. God will not be cheated by hypocritical fasts and ceremonies. Those who fast and pray, yet go on in sin, mock God and cheat themselves. 
Isa 59:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sins which prevented the bestowal of God's blessing and caused chastisements to fall upon Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit <br><b>Key Word</b> - Iniquities, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 20. Christ was the kinsman Redeemer who came to His own and was rejected. (John 1:11-12.) He is coming a second time to receive His own and to give full deliverance to Israel. (Rom. 11:25-26.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If prayers are not answered and the salvation we wait for is not wrought for us, it is not evidence that God is weary of hearing prayer, but that, for some reason, He cannot answer. Sin hides His face from us, provokes Him to withdraw His gracious presence and suspend the tokens of His favor. 
Isa 60:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The Deliverer out of Zion and the peace and joy of His coming. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's light, vv. 1, 3, 19. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. This had a near fulfillment in the first advent of Christ, who came as the Light of the world. However, He was rejected and the Church came in as a parenthesis. Christ is coming again, first for His Church as "the bright and morning star," and then to Israel and all the world, as the "sun of righteousness." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When the Redeemer shall appear in glory to be received as the Light of Israel, the knowledge of Him shall fill the whole earth and all the Gentile nations will honor them and flock to them. Wasting and destruction shall be no more and all will be filled with praise to God. 
Isa 61:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Two advents of Christ in one view. Kingdom blessing after the day of vengeance. Israel's restoration. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Universal righteousness, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. See Luke 4:16-21 and note that Jesus suspended the reading of this passage at the comma, after the word "Lord." The first advent opened the day of grace "the acceptable year of Jehovah," but does not fulfill the day of vengeance. When He returns this will be fulfilled being followed by the Kingdom of righteousness (4, 11). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - After the day of Christ's vengeance, comfort will be given to restored Israel. The setting up of the Kingdom in the earth will mean the repairing of all the waste places and all the ends of the earth shall see God's great salvation. 
Isa 62:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Restoration of Israel to God's favor, and honor with the nations. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's salvation, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - This prophecy was not fulfilled in the first advent and the preaching of the Gospel of grace. God has made definite promises to Israel, before whom Christ will yet appear again, to be recognized. We have no right to put the church in Israel's place in the promises. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Israel's full salvation is sure to come when they are regathered and their Redeemer recognized. In that day their land will no longer be called "desolate" but "Beulah land," and Jerusalem will be a praise in the earth. All the ends of the earth will know that God has pleaded Israel's cause and fulfilled His prophecies concerning them. 
Isa 63:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Day of vengeance, and the fear and hope of the remnant of Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Moses, Abraham. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Day of vengeance, v. 4.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. Rev. 19:11-21 describes this same day of vengeance, when Christ shall come forth in power, wearing vesture dipped in blood, crowned with many crowns and revealing Himself as King of Kings. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Christ is coming to tread the winepress of the wrath of God (Rev. 19:14-15) to take fierce vengeance on all sinners. In that day the remnant of Israel will remember their days of rebellion and will see how God has nourished them through the ages. 
Isa 64:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Fear and hope of remnant of Israel in day of vengeance. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Mercy implored, vv. 9, 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. This is likewise true of those saved under the Gospel of grace (1 Cor. 2:9) to whom is revealed by the Spirit the deep things of God as the result of their acceptance of the crucified and risen Savior. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The remnant of Israel in the day of Christ's vengeance will bewail their sins, thereby justifying God in all their afflictions, owning themselves unworthy of His mercy and thereby preparing for the deliverance He has promised them. 
Isa 65:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Answer of Jehovah to remnant of Israel. Eternal blessing in the renovated earth. <br><b>Characters</b> - God .<br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's hope, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Chap. 21 and 22 of Rev. look also to this same time of restoration of all things. The church appears then with Christ, as His Bride, to rule with Him, not as subjects of the earthly kingdom. Israel's glory in the prophecies is always an earthly glory. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Although Jehovah has long stretched forth His hand to a disobedient and gainsaying people, Israel, yet He will spare the remnant at Christ's return, purging them from their sins, establishing them in a purified earth. 
Isa 66:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Blessings of the coming universal Kingdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Universal kingdom, v. 23. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 16, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The Christian watches with great interest the providences of God towards the Jews, knowing that their return to their land is a preparation for the fulfillment of much prophecy, a sign of the approach of the close of the age and Christ's coming. "Come, Lord Jesus." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Following the day of Christ's vengeance the sorrows of Israel will be turned into abundant joys. All the Gentiles spared shall rejoice in her salvation. All nations will look upon the glory of God as it shines in the face of Christ, the King, and worship will be carefully and constantly attended upon by all the peoples of the earth. 
Jer 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's call and enduement. The sign of the almond rod and seething pot. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Jeremiah, Josiah, Jehoiakim. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Called of God, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 19. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God, by His special counsel and foreknowledge designs certain men for certain work for Himself, and whom He calls He fits for their work. Those having His message to deliver, while they should feel their own insufficiency, should not be afraid of the face of man, for God has pledged Himself to be with them. 
Jer 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - First message to backslidden Judah concerning their ingratitude to God and wickedness against Him. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah forgotten, v. 32. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13, 32. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is a great affront to God to neglect Him and forget Him, failing to acknowledge His kindnesses, withholding the tributes of love and praise due Him, and worst of all, to turn to idols which cannot possibly do them any good. Such backslidings are invariably followed with severe corrections that the backslider might read his sin in the punishment. 
Jer 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's message concerning the impenitence of Judah. Encouragement to backsliders to return and repent. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Backsliding Israel, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 23. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those will justly be divorced from God that join themselves to such as are rivals with Him, but God is ever ready to pardon sin and receive those who will return to Him humbly confessing their sins and acknowledging their dependence upon Him for salvation. 
Jer 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's second message, continued. Warning of the consequences of sin and exhortation to return to God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Desolations, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is the evil of men's doings that kindles the fires of God's wrath against them and brings destruction upon the land. That which is to be before He moves, which makes a way of escape for those who will sincerely turn to Him and receive His mercy, dreaded above everything else is the wrath of God, but God always warns .
Jer 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's second message, continued. God's charges against them and the judgments threatened. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vengeance, vv. 9, 29. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Sinners have reason to expect punishment on account of God's holiness to which sin is highly offensive. Sin will not go unpunished, else the honor of God's government cannot be maintained, and sinners will be tempted to think Him altogether such a one as themselves. 
Jer 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's second message, continued. The terrors that should come because of sin. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Desolations, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The God of mercy is loath to depart even from a provoking people, and earnestly entreats them by true repentance to prevent the necessity of His fierce judgments. Those who perish in their sin will be utterly forsaken of Him, and whom He forsakes is certainly undone. 
Jer 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The message in the gate of the Lord's house. Coming desolations because of sin. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Abominations, v. 30. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10, 1*1, 23. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is common for those who are furthest from God to boast themselves most of being in the Church, but God is holy and will not be the pattern of sin even though it be covered up in a form of godliness. When His anger breaks upon them, such sinners have only themselves to fhank. 
Jer 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message in the temple gate, continued. Terrible judgments impending. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Consuming judgment, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 22. The blood of Christ is a balm from Gilead for the healing of the sin-sick heart, and He is the great Physician who is all-sufficient for any case however difficult. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Impenitence brings certain ruin. All the boasted wisdom of man cannot serve to keep him from the consuming judgments pronounced upon those who mock at God's Word and take their own course. 
Jer 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message in the temple gate, continued. Detestation of the sins of the people. The vanity of trusting in anything but God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vengeance, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 23, 24. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who will not know God as their law giver will be made to know Him as their Judge. If the furnace of affliction will not purify them from their dross, He will cut them off with terrible desolations. 
Jer 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message in the temple gate, concluded. Greatness of the true God. Coming distresses in the land because of sin. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Distress, v. 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7, 10, 12, 23, 24. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jehovah is the one only living and true God, and to set up any other in competition with Him is the greatest affront. Those who will not believe His Word nor recognize His power will be made to feel His judgments to their ruin. 
Jer 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's message on the broken covenant. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Broken covenant, 8. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who enter into solemn covenant with God must expect on their part to fulfill the conditions, else He cannot on His part fulfill the promise. If we do not by obedience meet our end of the contract, we will by disobedience bring ourselves under its curses, and it is just with God to inflict heavy penalty. 
Jer 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message on the broken covenant, concluded. Jeremiah's complaint to God and God's rebuke. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prosperity of wicked, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When we find it hard to understand God's providences toward wicked men, we should remember His sure Word that "what a man soweth that shall he also reap." God often lets wicked men have a time of prosperity that by their pride and luxury they might fill up the measure of their iniquity, and so be ripening for a terrible destruction. 
Jer 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sign of the linen girdle and sign of the bottles filled with wine. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Punishment, v. 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16, 23. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who persist in sin, ignoring God's Word, make themselves vessels of wrath fitted to destruction. If one judgment does not do the work, God will send one upon another until they are utterly brought to ruin. 
Jer 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message on the drought. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Drought, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Man's sins bring those judgments upon the earth which make even the inferior creatures to groan. There will come a time when the sinners' expectation from God will utterly fail them. We should dread nothing more than God's departure from us. 
Jer 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message on the drought, concluded. The people abandoned to ruin. Jeremiah complains of his hardships.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Moses, Samuel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Destruction, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16, 21. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Miserable is the case of those who have sinned so long against God's mercy that at length they have sinned it away. There is no mercy for those who persist in apostasy.
Jer 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sign of the unmarried prophet, forecasting coming calamities. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God often makes men's sins their punishment and fills the backslider in heart with his own ways. Those have cut themselves off from all true peace who have thrown away the favor of God by persisting in wilful sin and idolatry. 
Jer 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sign of the unmarried prophet, concluded. Message in the gates <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 7, 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 5. Those who trust to their own righteousness and strength, thinking to get salvation without the merit and grace of Christ, thus make flesh their arm and fail of God's salvation. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The heart of man, out of communion with God, is wicked and deceitful above all things. Those who have wedded themselves to sin invite God's judgments upon their own heads. There is only disappointment and vexation for those who depend upon the arm of flesh instead of God, but those who by faith derive strength and grace from God will be enabled to do that which will redound to God's glory, the benefit of others and their own account. 
Jer 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sign of the potter's house. Declaration of God's ways of dealing with nations. Jeremiah's complaint. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Potter and clay, vv. 6, 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7, 8. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jehovah has incontestable and irresistible ability to form (frame) and fashion nations as He pleases. If they do not turn from evil ways, He will turn His hand against them. Sin ruins the comforts of nations, prolongs their grievances, and at length brings total ruin upon them. 
Jer 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sign of potter's house, concluded. Coming calamities .<br><b>Characters</b> - Jeremiah, Kings of Judah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Broken, v. 11. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let men great and small know that the Lord of Hosts is able to do what He threatens, and will therefore sorely punish those who have persisted in wickedness in spite of all His entreaties. They will be abandoned to utter ruin. 
Jer 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's first persecution. His complaint to God and encouragement in God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Pashur, Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Persecution, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 7, 8. Thus our Lord Jesus on the cross was reviled by priests and people for nothing but His faithful witness to God's Word. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who declare the whole counsel of God may expect to be plotted against, ridiculed and represented as dangerous to the government, which presents a strong temptation to stop preaching or tone down the message. However, the faithful preacher can successfully set all enemies at defiance, for Jehovah has promised to take his part, and to make the Word preached answer the end of its designs. 
Jer 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message to King Zedekiah. Babylonian captivity foretold. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Zedekiah, Pashur, Zephaniah, Nebuchadnezzar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's fury. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If God be for us, none can be against us, but if He be against us, who can be for us to stand us in any stead? Our God is a consuming fire, and when once He is angry because of men's sins, no one can stand in His sight. 
Jer 22:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message to Zedekiah, concluded. The King exhorted to execute judgment. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Zedekiah, Shallum, Jeremiah, Jehoiakim, Coniah, Nebuchadnezzar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Desolations, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13, 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 28, 30. Coniah was of David's line through Solomon, and the throne rights were cut off with Coniah. Joseph, the husband of Mary, was of this line. Had Jesus been born in the natural way, He would have had no title to the Davidic throne. However, Mary was of David's line through Nathan, the first born of David, and Jesus being conceived of the Holy Ghost, holds the royal title to the throne, which He will possess at His return. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God never casts one off until they cast Him off, but when men revolt from their allegiance to Him and trample under foot their covenants with Him, He gives them up to destruction, and who can contend with the destroyers of His preparing?
Jer 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Future restoration and conversion of Israel. Message against the faithless shepherds. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lying prophets, v. 25. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 24, 29, 32. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 5, 6. Jesus Christ is spoken of as the branch from David, small in His beginnings, but growing to be great and loaded with divine fruits. He is the Lord our righteousness (especially to be manifested . before the Jews at His coming again). He is the Lord (Jehovah), denoting eternity and self-existence. As Mediator, He is our righteousness. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Woe be to those who are commanded to feed God's people and pretend to do it, but instead drag them from God, speaking messages that are the product of their own invention, and slighting the authority of His Word. God disowns all prophets who soothe people in their sins. 
Jer 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sign of the figs. Judah's restoration, but not those of the second deportation.<br><b>Characters</b> - Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar, Jeconiah, Zedekiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Good and evil figs, v. 3. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The same providence which to some is a savour of death unto death may by God's grace be made to others a savour of life unto life. God knows all who are His, and will protect and deliver them whatever may come.
Jer 25:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecy of seventy years' captivity. Sign of the wine cup of fury. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jeremiah, Jehoiakim, Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Desolations, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - v. 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 29, 33. This prophecy leaps to the end of the age, the day of the Lord when Christ will return to execute God's wrath. Rev. 19:11-21; 14:14. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Men would never receive from God the desolating punishments did they not provoke Him by the evil of their persistent sin. That which is provocation to God will prove in the end at least the utter ruin of man, for the day of His fierce wrath is coming upon all the earth. 
Jer 26:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message in the temple court. Spiteful treatment of Jeremiah and his brave stand. Martyrdom of Urijah. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jehoiakim, Jeremiah, Micah, Hezekiah, Urijah, Elnathan, Ahikam. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Faithful prophet, vv. 14, 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's ambassador must keep close to divine instructions, not compromising to please men or to save himself. If he speaks what God appointed him to speak, he will be under God's protection, and whatever affront the people offer to the ambassador, it will be resented by God Himself. 
Jer 27:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sign of the yokes, to surrounding Gentile kings. Warning of great calamity. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jehoiakim, Nebuchadnezzar, Zedekiah, Jeconiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Yoke of Babylon, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who refuse to serve the God who made them may be justly made by God to serve their enemies who sought to ruin them. God has an indisputable right to dispose of kingdoms as He pleases. 
Jer 28:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sign of the yokes, continued. False prophecy and death of Hananiah. <br><b>Characters</b> - Zedekiah, Hananiah, Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar, Jeconiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - False teachers, v. 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those have a great deal to answer for who tell sinners that they shall have peace in spite of their contempt of the admonitions of God's Word and the exhortations of His true prophets. It is no new thing for lying prophets to father their message upon the God of truth, but they will surely be brought to shame. 
Jer 29:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message to the Jews of the first captivity. Action against false prophets. Destruction foretold. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar, Jeconiah, Elasah, Gemariah, Ahab, Zedekiah, Shemaiah, Zephaniah, Jehoiada. <br><b>Key Word</b> - True and false prophecies, vv. 20, 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 12, 13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - As long as we have God's sure Word before us, it is our own fault if we be deceived, for by it we may be undeceived. If vengeance shall be taken on those who rebel against God's Word, much more on those who teach rebellion by their destructive doctrines. 
Jer 30:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's first writing. Summary of Israel in the coming great tribulation. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jacob's trouble, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The time of Jacob's trouble is a period of seven years coming at the close of the present dispensation, followed immediately by the return of Christ in glory to set up His kingdom. See Christ's own Word: Matt. 24:15-31. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Israel, after many years of wandering among all nations, is to be finally purified in a season of tribulation such as the world has never known nor ever shall know thereafter. The purposes of God's wrath will all be fulfilled, and then Israel shall be gloriously restored as a nation. 
Jer 31:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Israel in the last days. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - New covenant, v. 31. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 33, 34. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 33, 34. This can be applied in the Gospel dispensation to those who have accepted Jesus Christ, those who are yielded to the Holy Spirit to have God's will revealed to them, and have the assurance that their sins through Christ are remembered no more. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God will again at the end of the age take Israel into new covenant relation with Himself, from which they have for hundreds of years been cut off because of rebellion against His Word. At that time, all shall come to the knowledge of God, and the earth shall be filled with songs of joy. 
Jer 32:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sign of the field of Hanameel. Jeremiah's second persecution, his prayer and Jehovah's answer. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzar, Hanameel, Baruch. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Chastisement and promises, v. 42. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 19, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. God, who has been faithful to His threatenings against Israel throughout the centuries, will just as certainly fulfill His promise to the remnant of them in His own good time when Christ returns. They will surely be re-gathered as a nation and made fruitful unto God (v. 42). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When we are perplexed about the methods of God's providence, it is good to go to Him in prayer, by which we shall be taught that not one word of all His counsel shall fail. Though we cannot reconcile one word with another, we may be sure both words are true and both will be made good. 
Jer 33:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecy concering the Davidic kingdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's joy, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. Christ is the Branch of righteousness, born of David's line and holding legal title to the promised throne. While under the gospel He is made "righteousness unto all true believers," at His return He will be acknowledged by Israel who rejected Him as their righteousness. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Davidic covenant will in God's- own time be literally fulfilled, to the great joy of the remnant of Israel when Christ shall come to execute judgment in righteousness in the earth. Their sins will be purged away, their nation will be honored by all nations, and to crown all their blessings, they will recognize Christ as their righteousness and worship Him as their King and Lord. 
Jer 34:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message to Zedekiah concerning the coming captivity. Zedekiah's ineffectual decree. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar, Zedekiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Desolations, v. 22. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's compassion toward us should engage our compassion toward our fellow-men, and in any case the plain statement of His Word should be obeyed. Those who will not be in subjection to God's law put themselves under His wrath and curse. 
Jer 35:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Obedience of the Rechabites in the reign of Jehoiakim.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Jehoiakim, Jaazaniah, sons of Hanan, Jonadab, <br><b>Key Word</b> - Obedience, v. 8. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The obedience of many unsaved people to the moral laws laid down by wise men of the world should put to shame many professing Christians who are disobedient to an infinite God and utterly forget His precepts.
Jer 36:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's writing in the days of Jehoiakim. Reading on the fast day. Burning of the roll and orders to persecute Jeremiah. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Jehoiakim, Josiah, Baruch, Gemariah, Michaiah. Elishama, Delaiah, Elnathan, Zedekiah, Jehudi, Jerahmeel, Seraiah, Shelemiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Book burned, vv. 2, 23. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Though the attempts of those who despise the Word of God are very daring, yet not one tittle of it shall fail. Though many a Bible be burned, this cannot abolish it nor deter the accomplishment of its prophecies. 
Jer 37:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's imprisonment in the days of Zedekiah. <br><b>Characters</b> - Zedekiah, Coniah, Nebuchadnezzar, Jeremiah, Jehucal, Zephaniah, Jonathan, Irijah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Imprisonment, v. 15. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is no new thing for those who have faithfully declared the Word of God and are the best friends of the Lord, to be represented as enemies, imprisoned and persecuted. When God's servants are accused, they may boldly deny the charge, commit their cause to Him who judges righteously, and continue to contend for the faith. 
Jer 38:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's imprisonment, continued. His private conference with the king. <br><b>Characters</b> - Shephatiah, Gedaliah, Jucal, Pashur, Jeremiah, Zedekiah, Malchiah, Ebed-melech, Jonathan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Persecuted, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 20. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's faithful ministers, who show men what enemies they are to themselves, are often looked upon as enemies of the country, and are wickedly abused. They may, however, commit the keeping of their spirits to God, their Rewarder, who can even raise up friends for them in their distress (vv. 8, 9), if it be for His glory. 
Jer 39:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Final captivity of Judah in accordance with the prophets. <br><b>Characters</b> - Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzar, Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Rab-mag, Nebuzaradan, Jeremiah, Nebushasban, Gedaliah, Ebed-melech. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Broken up, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 18. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Truly there is a God who judges in the earth in this world as well as in the next. When sin has provoked Him to withdraw His protection, the greatest city is helpless (the false prophets fell by those judgments which they said would never come. The true prophet Jeremiah escaped those judgments which he maintained would come). 
Jer 40:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah discharged. The Jews under Gedeliah as Governor. Ishmael's design against Gedeliah.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Nebuzaradan, Gedeliah, Ishmael, Johanan, Seraiah, Jezaniah, Baalis.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Jeremiah loosed, v. 4. Remnant of Judah, v. 11. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Sooner or later God's true prophets will be justified before the persecutors, and they will be made sensible that their sin is the cause of all their misery. (God in His wrath still remembers mercy and admits a remnant upon a further trial of their obedience.)
Jer 41:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Gedeliah slain, and many Jewish captives released by Johanan. <br><b>Characters</b> - Ishmael, Gedeliah, Asa, Nebuzaraden, Johanan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Murder, v. 2. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God sometimes permits bloody work to be done for the completing of the ruin of an unhumbled people and the filling up of the measure of their judgments. Murderous work should inspire us with awe of God's judgments, as well as with indignation at the wickedness of men. 
Jer 42:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - God's answer to the inquiry of the people and Jeremiah concerning the calamities recently befallen. God's charge to the people in the land. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Johanan, Jezaniah, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Admonished, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In very difficult circumstances, our eyes must be upon God for direction, and our hearts much be intent on obeying His voice. It is folly to quit the place where God has put us merely because we have met with trouble in it. The difficulty we think to escape by disobeying God's voice we will inevitably run ourselves into. 
Jer 43:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah carried to Tahpanhes in Egypt. Sign of the hidden stones. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Azariah, Johanan, Baruch, Nebuzaradan, Gedeliah, Nebuchadnezzar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Disobedience, v. 4. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is common for unhumbled men who persist in sin to represent those who speak God's word as grafters having designs for themselves. However, this does not change the Word of God, and those who think to better themselves by going contrary to the Scriptures will come to ruin. 
Jer 44:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message to the Jews in Egypt. Further judgments threatened. Contempt of the people for the admonitions. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Pharaoh-hophra, Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah provoked, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 28 (b). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's past dealings with sinful people should be a warning to us of the danger of sin and the fatal consequences of it. To those who are impenitent sinners God will be found an implacable Judge. In a contest between God's Word and man's word, God's Word will be sure to stand. 
Jer 45:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message of Baruch in the days of Jehoiakim. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Baruch. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Impending evil, v. 5. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God takes notice of the frets and discontents of His people and is displeased with them. To seek great things for ourselves when the public is in danger is unbecoming. We should count even the preservation of our lives in such times a great mercy, and continue faithful to our service. 
Jer 46:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecies against Egypt. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Pharaoh-Necho, Nebuchadrezzar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Day of vengeance, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 27, 28, certainly look forward to the judgments of the nations at the coming of Christ (Matt. 25:42) after Armageddon, (Rev. 16:14), and the deliverance of Israel. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When men think to magnify themselves by pushing on unrighteous enterprises, let them expect that God will sooner or later glorify Himself by blasting them and making an end of them, for He has numberless hosts at His command.' 
Jer 47:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecies against Philistia and Tyre and Sidon. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Cut off, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The sword of the Word, as it is charged from the Lord of Hosts to punish the crimes of nations, cannot be sheathed until it has accomplished that for which He has sent it. 
Jer 48:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecy against Moab. Characters: God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Spoiling and destruction, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jehovah has all armies at His command. He will in His own time plead the cause of His people against a people that have always been vexatious to them and rebellious toward Him, and will punish them until there is nothing left of them.
Jer 49:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecies against the Ammonites, Edom, Damascus, Kedar, kingdoms of Hazor, Elam. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Nebuchadrezzar, Zedekiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Desolations, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16 (a). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Nations that despise and persecute God's people may make a mighty figure for a time, but their pride shall deceive them, for God will surely visit them with desolations, and they themselves shall be despised among men. 
Jer 50:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecies against Babylon and Chaldea. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, King of Assyria, Nebuchadrezzar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vengeance, v. 28. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 34. It is the comfort of Christians in distress that they have a Redeemer, Jesus Christ, who is strong, and will thoroughly plead their cause and give them rest. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The pride of men's hearts sets God against them and ripens them in due time for utter ruin. Whatever wrong is done against God's people will certainly be reckoned, for though God may have used their persecutions for the good of His people, God has a variety of instruments at command in the earth, and when He opens His armories, all enemies will find themselves overmatched. 
Jer 51:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecies against Babylon, continued. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah, Nebuchadrezzar, Seraiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgment, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 15. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let no nation think it will exempt them from God's judgment that they have been executing God's judgments on others. Those who have proudly carried everything before them will at length meet with their match, and their day will come to pass. 
Jer 52:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - A retrospect: overthrow and capture of Judah. The latter days of Jehoiachin. <br><b>Characters</b> - Zedekiah, Jeremiah, Jehoiachin, Jehoiakim, Nebuchadrezzar, Seraiah, Zephaniah, Evil-merodach. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Behold His anger, v. 3. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Iniquity leads to the certain ruin of those who follow it, and if it be not forsaken will certainly end by the sinner being cast out of God's presence. The unbelief of man shall not make God's threatenings of no effect, but events will fully answer the predictions of His Word. 
Lam 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jeremiah's first complaint of the calamities of Judah. Appeal to God for deliverance. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Comforters, vv. 2, 17, 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 18 (b). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Whatever our troubles are which God is pleased to inflict upon us, we must own that therein He is righteous and we are sinful. Our fetters are usually of our own making, and it is with our own rod that we are beaten. Those who are without God's presence are without all true comfort. 
Lam 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Lamentation on the effect of the calamities of Judah. God's passionate consideration appealed to. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Swallowed up, v. 5.  <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17 (a). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The wormwood and gall in affliction is the thought that God has become one's enemy in His hot displeasure at sin. In all sore providences, it is well to reflect that God has fulfilled His Word, for there will be found to be a perfect agreement between the judgments of God's hand and those threatened by His Word upon the unrepentant. 
Lam 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Complaint of God's displeasure and comfort to God's people. Appeal to God's justice against persecutors. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Bitterness, v. 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 31, 32, 33. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Bad as things may be, it is owing to the mercy of God that they are not worse, for if we had been dealt with according to our sins, we should have been consumed long ago. Since we are dealt with according to God's mercy, we should acknowledge it to His praise. 
Lam 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Lamentation on the direful effects of calamities of Judah. Sins of the leaders acknowledged. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Devoured, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9<br><b>Conclusion</b> - Nothing ripens a people more for ruin, nor fills the measure faster than the sins of the priests and prophets (v. 13), by which they are led blindly away from God and into His judgments. 
Lam 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Lamentation of the state of Judah in captivity. Supplications for the return of mercy. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - No rest, vv. 7, 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 19. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All our woes are owing to our own sin and folly, and God is therefore righteous in it. Though we may not quarrel with God, we may yet plead with Him and hope for mercy even when He seems to have utterly forsaken. 
Eze 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the glory. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Christ, Ezekiel, Jehoiachin, (v. 26). <br><b>Key Word</b> - Visions of God, v. 1. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 26. We have here a glimpse of the glory and dignity of Christ at His incarnation, a hint of what His condescension was in taking upon Himself the form of a servant and giving Himself to the death of the cross. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - While no man has seen God at any time, many have had visions of Him, displays of divine glory, which prostrated man before Him in humbled sense of his own unworthiness, and of the infinite distance between man and God. The more God is pleased to make known to us of His glory, the more humble we should be before Him. 
Eze 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ezekiel filled with the Spirit, and his divine command. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Called, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. It is Christ's prerogative to call ministers, enjoin them in their work, and fill them with the Spirit for it (John 15:16). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If we stand ready to be used of God, we may expect that He will give us a commission. He is pleased to work that in us which He requires of us. Those who will do anything to purpose in His service must not be afraid of the voice of man, but faithfully deliver the message regardless of its reception. 
Eze 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ezekiel's commission, continued. Again filled with the Spirit. His dumbness. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Watchman, v. 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9, 18, 19, 27. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Ministers are God's mouth to the children of men, but must not undertake to preach the things of God until the Word of God has become part of themselves. Those who keep close to Him need not fear the proud looks of men. If the minister is not faithful to his trust, a loss of souls will be charged upon him in the day of account. Though ministers do not faithfully warn the wicked, it shall not be admitted as an excuse for sin the wicked will die in their iniquity. 
Eze 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The sign of the tile. Typical representations. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's iniquity, v. 5. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If men will not serve God with cheerfulness in the abundance of all things, God will make them serve their enemies in the want of all things. In times of public distress, God's ministers must be willing to endure hardness that they may evidence the sincerity of their faith and  serve the glory of God. 
Eze 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sign of the sharp knife. Famine, pestilence and the sword impending. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgments, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 8. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When nations (or persons) are made great, it is with design that they may do good, and that they may be as a light to other nations. Contempt of God's Word opens the door to all manner of iniquity, and brings judgments that utterly destroy. Those who refuse God's terms of prosperity cannot expect the continuance of His favor. 
Eze 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message against the mountains of Israel. Remnant to be spared. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Desolations, v. 4. Strong Verses : 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10 .<br><b>Conclusion</b> - If men do not, as they ought, destroy idolatry, God will first or last find a way to do it, for idolatry is spiritual whoredom, and therefore  a great wrong to God's honor. 
Eze 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Miserable end of Judah because of sin. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Day of trouble, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 19. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The ruin of sinners comes slowly but surely, but when it comes, it will be total. In the heaviest judgments God inflicts, He does but recompense to sinners their own ways. They are beaten with a rod of their own making. 
Eze 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Third vision of the glory. The former profanation of the temple and God's anger because of sin. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, Jaazaniah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Abominations, v. 6. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those are ripe indeed for ruin who have given themselves over to idols, turning their backs upon God and His Word. When their punishment comes, God will be as deaf to their cries as their own idols, to which they vainly cried before. 
Eze 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Visions of the slaying in Jerusalem. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Day of recompense, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. The man clothed in fine linen certainly represents Christ as Mediator, saving those who are His from the flaming sword of vengeance coming upon the earth. This He will do at the end of the age. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who live in sin and hate to be reformed, despising God's Word, will perish in sin, and deserve not to be pitied, for they could have prevented their ruin, but would not. None of those, however, shall be lost whom God has marked for life and salvation. 
Eze 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Visions of the altar fire scattered over Jerusalem. Description of the cherubim. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Glory, v. 4. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. The man in fine linen (same as Chap. 9). The same Jesus who is the Saviour and Protector of those who believe, as all judgment is committed to Him, will come in flaming fire to take vengeance upon sinners. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's glory and government infinitely transcend all the brightest ideas our minds can receive concerning them. The wheels of his providence move with steadiness and regularity, and all His disposals may be looked upon with wonder, for whatever He pleases He does.    
Eze 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of wrath against lying princes. Promise to spare the remnant. Israel's coming restoration and converson. Departure of the glory from Jerusalem. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Ezekiel, Jaazaniah, Pelatiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgment, v. 10. (Remnant, v. 13.) <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 19,20,21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 17, 21. At the Second Coming of Christ, the Jews will be given a new heart, not divided as it has been through the ages among many gods, a new spirit agreeable to Christ, whom they hated. They will look upon Him whom they pierced and will mourn. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The fear of the wicked shall come upon him, and there is no fence against the judgment of God. Woe to those entrusted with God's message, who have hidden from the people the things belonging to their peace, for in the day of recompense God will lay at their door the guilt of souls perishing on their account. 
Eze 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the prophet as a sign. Full captivity near at hand. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Captivity (vv. 7, 11) at hand (v. 23). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2 5 ( a ) . <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Sinners often try to think their works are not evil because sentence upon them is not executed speedily. Putting the evil day far off only provokes God to bring it sooner, and to make it so much the sorer, and so much more a surprise and terror. 
Eze 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message against lying prophets. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - False prophets, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Matt. 7:22-23. It is Christ who will say to the false preachers in that day, "I never knew you." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Since the devil is the father of lies, those put the highest affront upon God who, claiming to be his prophets, tell lies and father them upon God. A thousand woes upon those who have thus deceived the people and made God their enemy. Though they had claimed to be favorites of heaven, they will in the last day be shown to be the favorites of the devil. 
Eze 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the elders of Israel. Jerusalem on no account to be spared. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, Noah, Job, Daniel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Heart idols, v. 3. (Sore judgments, v. 21.) <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Many who have no idols in their sanctuary have idols in their hearts, which is no less a usurpation of God's throne. Those who have made gods of money and sensual pleasure cannot expect an answer of peace from God, but on the contrary are ripening for utter ruin. 
Eze 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the burning vine. Characters: God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Devour, v. 7. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who set their faces against God to contradict His Word and defeat His purposes will find His face set against them to their ruin. 
Eze 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The harlotry of Jerusalem, and threatening of destroying judgments. Promises of future blessing under the new covenant. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jerusalem's harlotry, vv. 16, 35. ng Verses : 59. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let not men flatter themselves with a conceit that because God has hitherto continued His favors to them, notwithstanding their provocations, He will continue to do so, for ultimately as they have forsaken God, they will be utterly forsaken to ruin by God. If sin is not cast off by repentance, it must be borne to eternal confusion. 
Eze 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parable of the great eagle. Rebellion of Zedekiah and its results. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, Zedekiah, Pharaoh. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Broken covenant, vv. 18, 19. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - He who breaks covenant with God, and tramples the directions of His Word under foot, cannot hope to be delivered from that vengeance which is the just punishment of such treachery. God can without any difficulty root up sinful men and whole kingdoms. Key Word: Broken covenant, vv. 18, 19. 
Eze 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ethical instructions for Israel in captivity. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Righteousness and wickedness, v. 20. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 9, 20, 21, 22, 23, 32. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - He who makes conscience of conforming in everything to the will of God, who makes it his business to serve God, and his aim to glorify God, shall without fail be happy here and hereafter, and wherein he comes short of his duty, it shall be forgiven him. Let the impenitent thank themselves if they fall under God's curse, for the soul that sinneth shall neither have peace in this life nor salvation in the next. The God of heaven has no delight in man's ruin. 
Eze 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Lamentation for princes of Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lamentation, vv. 1, 14. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's ministers who have foretold His judgments upon sinners should bitterly lament the destruction of sinners when it comes, as those who have not desired the woeful day. Sinners may thank themselves for the fire that consumes them, for they have by their wickedness made themselves like tinder to the sparks of God's wrath. 
Eze 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah vindicated in the chastising of Israel. Israel's future judgment. Parable of the forest of the south field. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's long-suffering, vv. 9, 14, 17, 22. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 19, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 33-44. This prophecy has to do with the future judgment of Israel at Christ's Coming. The issue determines who of Israel in that day shall enter the land for kingdom blessing. (Ezekiel 20:38; Psalm 50:1-7; Malachi 3:2-5; 4:1, 2.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God takes it as an affront when those come to inquire of Him who are resolved to go on in their trespasses. He is indeed long-suffering with sinners, and it is owing purely to His mercy, which guards His own glory, that they are not immediately made an end of. If men will not acknowledge God as their ruler, they will have to face Him as Judge when it is too late. 
Eze 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parable of the sighing prophet, and of the sword of God. No king for Israel until Messiah comes to reign. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Ezekiel, King of Babylon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's sword, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 27. Jesus Christ has incontestable title to the kingship, not only of Israel, but the whole world, and in due time He will have the possession. Until that time, there will be a general and continual overturning of kingdoms. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When the sword is unsheathed among nations, God's hand must be owned in it, for His wrath against sin often puts an edge upon the sword, and the instruments He uses in executing judgments, He fills with strength and fury according to the service they are employed in. 
Eze 22:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sins of Israel enumerated. Parable of the dross in the furnace. Sins of priests, prophets and people. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Abominations, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14,30,31. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Whatever God's wrath inflicts upon a people, it is their own way that is recompensed upon their heads, and God deals with them much better than their iniquity deserves. 
Eze 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parable of Aholah and Aholibah. Sentence passed upon Judah. <br><b>Characters</b> - Ezekiel, Aholah, Aholibah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Whoredoms, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 49. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Whatever creature we dote upon we make an idol of, and what we make an idol of, we defile ourselves with. Forgetfulness of God is at the bottom of all such adulterous departures from Him. 
Eze 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parable of the boiling pot. Ezekiel again made a sign to Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, King of Babylon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vengeance v. 8. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is a day coming when it will be said, "He that is filthy, let him be filthy still." The declarations of God's wrath against sinners are as inviolable as the assurances He has given His people of His favor. 
Eze 25:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecy against the Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites and Philistines. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgments, v. 11. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who glory in any other defence than divine power and promises will sooner or later see cause to be ashamed of their glory. Those who rejoice in the calamities befalling God's people will shortly be reckoned with. 
Eze 26:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Coming judgment upon Tyre. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, Nebuchadnezzar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Tyrus' destruction, v. 17. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is just with God to blast the designs and projects of those who contrive to raise themselves upon the ruin of others, and let them not expect to prosper long, for the Lord of Hosts is against them to bring them down to the dust. 
Eze 27:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Lamentation for Tyre. Characters: God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lamentation, vv. 2, 32. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God takes notice of the vain conceits men have of themselves in their prosperity. When they pride themselves on pomp and pleasure, and think themselves perfect, because of their worldliness, He will find a way to bring down their estate to the dust. 
Eze 28:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Rebuke of the King of Tyre, and the fate of Satan who inspired him. Zidon's judgment and Israel's regathering.  <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, Daniel, King of Tyre, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Brought down, vv. 8, 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17 (See Rev. 20:10). <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 12-18 go beyond the King of Tyre to Satan, the real but unseen ruler of Tyre. His unfallen state is here described. For his fall see Isa. 14:12-14.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who pretend to be rivals with God will certainly be shown that they are but men weak, timorous, trembling and perishing men. 
Eze 29:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecy against Egypt. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Desolations, v. 9. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who abuse their power will justly be stripped of it. Those who pride themselves in prosperity, forgetting that God is proprietor of the earth, will be forced out of it. God may even use bad men as tools to bring about His purposes. 
Eze 30:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Egypt in the day of Jehovah. God against Pharaoh in the war with Babylon. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgments, v. 19. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Nothing can protect a provoking people when God comes forth to contend with them. God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another for the executing of His judgments upon sin. 
Eze 31:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecy against Pharaoh. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, Pharaoh. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Pride punished, vv. 10, 11. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is rare to find a humble spirit in the midst of great advancement. God can easily expel those who think themselves, and seem to others, to have taken deepest root. Pride goeth before a fall. 
Eze 32:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Lamentation for Pharaoh and Egypt. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, Pharaoh, Nebuchadrezzar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lamentation, vv. 2, 16. Terrors, v. 32. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Great potentates, if they be tyrannical and oppressive, are in God's account no better than beasts of prey, and will be shortly devoured. The nation that has terrorized others will eventually be made a terror to itself. (God's messengers should sympathize with the miseries which sinners bring upon themselves. It becomes them to weep for sinners who will not weep for themselves.) 
Eze 33:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ethical instructions for the captivity. Rebuke to those who are not sincere in their professions. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, Abraham. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Warning, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 31, 32. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 12-13. Many have been ruined by trusting to the merit of their own righteousness, and thinking that God is so much their debtor that they may therefore venture to commit a little sin. "The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him." (Rom. 4:5-8; 10:1). Happy is the man who is clothed with the righteousness of Jesus Christ and in whom Christ lives. (Gal. 2:20.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God warns sinners of the wrath to come that they may flee from it. Those who go promiscuously into the mouth of judgment, though they hear the warnings of God's servants against the dangers of sin, have destroyed themselves. 
Eze 34:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message to the faithless shepherds of Israel. Promise of restoration of Israel, and setting up of the kingdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Shepherds, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 15, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 23, 29. Jesus is coming as the Great Shepherd (Heb. 13:20) to gather His people and make a final covenant of peace with Israel. He is the "plant of renown," far above all principalities and might and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but that which is to come. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those will have a great deal to answer for in the day of judgment who took upon them the care of souls as under-shepherds, yet never took any care of them. Happy are they who know Christ, the Good Shepherd, being fed in His pastures and blessed with all spiritual blessings in Him. 
Eze 35:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecy against Mount Seir. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Desolations, vv. 3, 9, 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who have a perpetual enmity to God and His people must expect eventually to be made a perpetual desolation. Those who have lived to shed blood will be given blood to drink. 
Eze 36:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message to the mountains of Israel. Restoration of Israel predicted. Israel's past sins. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Mountains of Israel, v. 1. Restoration, v. 24. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 23 (b), 26, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The restoration of Israel is yet future. The remnant which returned after the seventy years and their posterity were continually under Gentile yoke. In A. D. 70 they were driven into dispersion, which still continues. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who put shame and reproach upon God's people, though God may have made it serve a purpose to His end, will sooner or later have it turned upon themselves. God takes occasion from the insolence of enemies to show Himself concerned for His people, ready to do them good. 
Eze 37:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the valley of dry bones. Sign of the two sticks. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Ezekiel, Joseph, Ephraim, Judah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Dry bones, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 6, 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 22. As bone came to bone, so the Israelites scattered over the earth will come to their respective families and tribes in the last day. Then Christ will come to be recognized as King, in allegiance to whom all will cheerfully unite. (Many believe David will sit upon the literal throne of Jerusalem as representative of Christ, the great Ruler in the air above.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - He who made man so fearfully and wonderfully can in like manner make him new. Scattered atoms can be marshalled in their proper place and every bone can be made to come to its place by the same wisdom and power by which bones were first formed in the womb. 
Eze 38:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecy against Gog. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Gog, v. 3. (Latter days, v. 16.) <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - This prophecy should be read in connection with Zech. 12:1-4; 14:1-9; Matt. 24:14-30; Rev. 14:14-20; 19:17-21. Many see a reference to the northern European powers headed by Russia in the last days to wage a great war. The reference to Mesheck (Moscow) and Tubal (Zobolsk) is thought to be clear identification. The prophecy belongs to the future battle of Armageddon. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God does not only see those who are now the enemies of His people, but foresees those who will be so in the last days, and lets them know by His Word that He is against them, and will make their movements to serve His own purposes. 
Eze 39:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecy against Gog, continued. Vision of restored and converted Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Ezekiel, Gog. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Gog, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 21, 23, 24. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The powers in the last days that rise up to oppress Israel and work havoc in the earth will be made to know by dear-bought experience that Jehovah is the God of power and the Saviour of Israel, even though they seem long to have been neglected by Him. In that day the slaughter will be so great that there will not be a sufficient number of the enemies left alive to bury their dead. God will then let all nations know the leaning of all Israel's troubles, and will get glory to Himself, and their cleansing and restoration. 
Eze 40:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the man with the measuring reed. The future temple and its service.  <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, sons of Zadok. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Temple. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - A great and beautiful temple, framed in detail in the counsel of God, is to be set up in Jerusalem in the millennial age, for the setting forth of the truths of God's Word. 
Eze 41:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Further description of the temple. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Temple. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Same as Chap. 40. 
Eze 42:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Further description of the temple.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Temple. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Same as Chap. 40. 
Eze 43:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of God's glory filling the temple. Place of the throne of the future kingdom. The altar and offerings. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Temple, glory (v. 2), throne (v. 7), offerings (vv. 18-27).  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The glory of God shall return to earth in the kingdom age, filling the new temple, and Israel will once more offer their appointed and acceptable sacrifices in praise to God. 
Eze 44:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Gate for the prince. God's glory filling the temple. <br><b>Characters</b> - The priests, God, Ezekiel, sons of Zadok, prince. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Temple services. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In the great temple of Jehovah in the kingdom age, Israel shall worship with a new heart, and every detail of the temple services will be carried out according to God's appointment. 
Eze 45:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's portion of the land and the prince's portion. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, prince. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Portion of land, v. 1. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In the kingdom age Israel will honor Jehovah with portions of land set apart for divine service. Sin offerings will be offered according to God's appointment, for while sin will be suppressed, the tendency to sin is not removed until the new heaven and new earth are established. 
Eze 46:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Worship of the prince and people, and the offerings. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, prince. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Offerings, v. 4. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Israel will acknowledge their dependence upon Jehovah in the kingdom age with many offerings according to a divine plan for that period, by which perfect fellowship may be maintained. 
Eze 47:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - River of the new sanctuary. Borders of the land. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - River of sanctuary, v. 1; borders, v. 13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Rev. 22:1-2; Zech. 14:8-9. 
Eze 48:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Division of the land. The city and its gates. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Ezekiel, prince. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Borders, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 35 (b). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The tribes of Israel will in the kingdom age be distributed according to the divine counsels by a plan different from that previously known. The chief glory of the land will be the manifestations of Jehovah's presence in the city of His choice. 
Dan 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Personal history of Daniel. Reason for appearance of Daniel and his friends before Nebuchadnezzar. <br><b>Characters</b> - Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel, Hananiah, Judah, Mishae, Azariah,Ashpenaz, Cyrus, Jehoiakim, Melzar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Heart purpose, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - This book is written by a man "greatly beloved" (9:23), and deals with much the same prophecies as those of Revelation written by "the beloved disciple," (John). Note similarity between the two:  1. In captivity. Dan. 1:6; 8:2; Rev. 1:9. 2. Beloved. 10:11; John 13:23. 3. Heard the Lord's voice. 8:16; 10:9; Rev. 1:10. 4. Saw the Lord's face. Dan. 10:6; Rev. 1:14. 5. Prostrated. 10:8-9; Rev. 1:17. 6. Quickened. 10:10, 18; Rev. 1:17. 7 Angel taught. 10:11, 12; Rev. 1:1. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Plain living and high thinking go together. When God's people are in Babylon, they should take special care that they partake not of her sins (Psa. 141:4). It is to the praise of God's people not to relish the delights of sense, but to look upon them with indifference. 
Dan 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - mis: Visions of Nebuchadnezzar and their results. The forgotten dream  and the failure of the astrologers. Daniel's interpretation after prayer  for wisdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, Abedego, Arioch, Astrologers. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Dreams, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 20, 21, 22, 44. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The vision has to do with the course of the times of the Gentiles, during which four great world kingdoms would succeed each other. The last of the four (Rome) would divide into legs and then into ten toes (7:27). (Gentile world powers of the last days.) The smiting stone (7:34-35) is to destroy this system of kingdoms in its final form by a sudden blow from heaven (not by gradual process). (See Dan. 7:1-28; Rev. 13-19.) When this destruction comes it will be immediately followed by the kingdom of Christ, which will fill the whole earth at once. Christ is the stone cut out without hands, who will smite the nations, and then become a great mountain, filling the earth with His glory. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The wisest of men are clouded with a veil of flesh which confounds their understanding of divine things. The sacred things belong to the Lord our God, but believers by prayer are let into His mysteries concerning the last days. The kings of earth have no power but what is given them from above, and in due time all earth kingdoms will be done away and replaced by the eternal kingdom of Christ on earth. 
Dan 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Pride of Nebuchadnezzar and his punishment. The image of gold.  The three Jews refuse to worship the image. Fiery furnace proven harm-  less. The king convinced. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Nebuchadnezzar, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Deliver, vv. 17, 28. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 25. Many think this was the eternal Son of God, not a created angel. Hereby Christ shows that what is done against His people He takes as done against Himself. Whoever throws them into the furnace do in effect throw Him in (Isa. 63:9). Those who suffer for Him are therefore assured of His precious presence with them. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We should obey the powers that be until they tell us to disobey and dishonor God (Rom. 13:1), then we should obey God rather than man (Acts 5:29). If we are called to pass through the fire, Christ walked there before us, and will walk there with us (John 15:20), and nothing will be lost by being true to Him. 
Dan 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Nebuchadnezzar's proclamation. The true vision and its interpretation. Vision fulfilled; the restoration of Nebuchadnezzar. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar, Astrologers. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Pride abased, v. 37. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 35, 37. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God has power to humble the haughtiest of men who would in their pride act in competition with Him. Those so confident of their own sufficiency will be brought sooner or later to own God's dominion over them and their own utter weakness. Many have been brought to themselves by being made beside themselves. 
Dan 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Daniel's personal history under Belshazzar and Darius. The pride of Belshazzar and his downfall. The writing on the wall. Its interpretation and fulfillment. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Belshazzar, Queen, Daniel, Darius, Nebuchadnezzar, Astrologers. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Pound wanting, v. 27. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 21. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God expects from the greatest of men that their hearts will be humbled before Him by acknowledgment that, great as they are, to Him they are accountable. If they persist in their pride and impenitence, they will be made to know that the Most High God rules. 
Dan 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Daniel's history to the accession of Cyrus. Decree of Darius. Daniel's steadfastness. Daniel in the lion's den and his deliverance. Darius' new decree. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Daniel, Darius, Princes. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Delivered, vv. 16, 20, 23. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 10, 16 (b), 23 (b), 26. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - "God first" means "safety first." That which believers do faithfully in conscience toward God may often be represented as done with obstinate motives by men, but God knows the heart, and whatever the test, will give peace and deliverance, and will clear the integrity of His trusting child. 
Dan 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The beast vision of Daniel, forecasting the four world empires and the final heading up under anti-Christ. Vision of Christ coming in glory. Interpretation of the beast vision. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Daniel, Belshazzar, anti-Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Kingdom visions, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 14, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 13, 14; identical with Rev. 5:6-10. The order of events will be:  1. Investure of Christ's earthly kingdom (13, 14; Rev. 5:6-10).  2. The vexing of Psa. 2:5. See also Matt. 24:21, 22; Rev. 6:18. 3. Return of Christ in glory to deliver the smiting blow of 2:45; 7:9-11; Rev. 19:11-21. 4. Judgment of nations and setting up of kingdom  (7:10, 26, 27; Matt. 25:31-46; Rev. 20:1-6).  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The thrones of the kingdoms of this world in their final heading up will be thrown down. The people of God in every age should be encouraged under their troubles with the prospect of Christ's coming in glory, for God has sworn that he will in due time put His King upon the throne of earth and make an end of all unrighteous rule. 
Dan 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The ram and rough goat vision, and its interpretation. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Gabriel, Daniel, Belshazzar, anti-Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - End-time Indignation, v. 19. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 23,24,25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Two ends are in view in this chapter historically the end of the Grecian empire of Alexander; prophetically, the end of the times of the Gentiles (Luke 21:24; Rev. 16:14), when the "little horn" of 7:8, 24-26, the beast, will arise, followed by the return of Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Out from the kingdoms of the last days a king of fierce countenance, the anti-Christ, will arise, and acting by the power 'of Satan, will bring transgression to the full. Though he will for a time prosper in his hellish schemes, the sudden brightness of Christ's coming will utterly destroy him. 
Dan 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the seventy weeks. Daniel's prayer and confession. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Daniel, Jeremiah, Darius, Gabriel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prayer, v. 3. Vision, v. 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 24-27. Reduced to calendar years, this 69 weeks of years (v. 25) is 476 years. The edict to restore Jerusalem was issued 446 B. C. Applying 476 to this point brings us to Christ's birth and 30 years over, the very time of the cutting off of Messiah by His crucifixion (v. 26). Luke 3:23 says that Jesus began His ministry at 30 years and an error is imagined by some, but Scripture is accurate, for when in the sixth century, the time A. D. and B. C. was divided, an error of four years was made in the calendar so that really 30 A. D. is 34. Christ's ministry extended nearly four years; thus 30 A. D. in our chronology was the time of Christ's death. At the close of the age, the other week of years will be fulfilled in awful tribulation, after which Christ will appear suddenly in the clouds to set up His eternal kingdom. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's Word is intended to encourage our prayers, and when we see the day of the performance of His prophecies approaching, we should the more earnestly confess our sins and pray, not only being forward to speak to God, but as forward to hear what He has to say to us. 
Dan 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Visions of the glory of God. The heavenly messenger detained, but comes at last to show Daniel things to come, in answer to prayer. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Daniel, Michael, Cyrus, Princes of Persia and Greece. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Great vision, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 19, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 6, 16, 17. Christ here appears in the same resemblance wherein He appeared to John in Rev. 1:13-15, viz., in His priestly dress, girded ready to His work on behalf of His people. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - From the day that we begin to look toward God in the way of duty, He is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. When we rightly understand the methods of God's providence and grace concerning us, we will be better reconciled to them. Failure to complete transactions with God is responsible for many unanswered prayers. 
Dan 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecy covering the period from Darius to anti-Christ, showing the conflicts of nations, and final heading up for destruction. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Daniel, Kings of Persia and Greece, anti-Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Time of the end, v. 40. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 32, 33. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 45. This was not fulfilled in Antiochus, for he died in Tabal, Persia. This man, the anti-Christ, will come to his end in Judea between Jerusalem and the Mediterranean, and it is the brightness of Christ's coming only that will bring him to his doom (2 Thess. 2:8' Rev 19:20). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - That which God has declared in His Word concerning the end of kingdoms shall surely come to pass, and then the sins of men and the wickedness of anti-Christ and Satan shall be made to serve His purposes and contribute to the bringing of his counsels to birth in their season. Though sin comes to an awful heading up under anti-Christ, it will surely come to  eternal destruction when Christ conies to set up His glorious kingdom. 
Dan 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The great tribulation of the last days, and the resurrection foretold. The last message to Daniel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Daniel, Michael. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Time of the end, vv. 4, 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The time of the end or day of Jacob's trouble (Jeremiah 30:7), will be a time of tribulation such as was not from the beginning of the world, nor ever shall be (Matt. 24:21). The New Testament adds many details concerning it. But for the appearing of Christ in glory no flesh would be spared through it. Those who know Christ as their Saviour will not be called upon to pass through it (Rev. 3:10), but will be caught up before it begins (1 Thess. 4:16-18). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The present age is to close in a time of tribulation such as the world has never known. Christ will come to save His people and to raise the bodies of many from the dust. Glorious rewards will be conferred upon those who have themselves been wise and have instructed others in the way of salvation. 
Hos 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Israel, Jehovah's dishonored wife, repudiated, but to be restored. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Hosea, Uzziah, Hezekiah, Jeroboam, Gomer, Jezreel, Jehu, Lo-ruhamah, Lo-ammi. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel whoredom, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 11. The day will come (Rom. 11:25) when Israel will come forth out of the lands, acknowledging Jesus Christ whom they crucified, as their head (Zech. 12:10). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Giving glory to any creature which is due to God alone is as much an injury and affront to God as for a wife to embrace the bosom of a stranger, is to her husband. Thus many who have been in covenant relation with God have broken their marriage bond, turning away the mercy of God from their houses. 
Hos 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The chastisement of adulterous Israel. Yet to be restored. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Hosea, Ammi, Ruhamah, Baalim. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's harlotry, restoration, vv. 5, 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 18, 19, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 14-23. In the final day of Israel's despair, God has promised to revive her with comforts the sight of their coming Messiah. In that day they will be betrothed to Him anew forever, and the earth shall be filled with His eternal peace and righteousness. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who exchange the service of God for the service of the world and the flesh will sooner or later be made to own that they have changed for the worse, finding themselves cast off of God and hedged about with thorns. Woe unto us, if God will not own Himself in relation to us. 
Hos 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's undying love to Israel. The future kingdom on earth.  <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Hosea. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's harlotry, restoration, vv. 3, 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 5. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 4-5. The reference may be to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of David, to whom God gave the throne of His father David Luke 1:32. The Chaldee translates it, "they shall seek the service of the Lord their God, and shall obey Messiah, the Son of David, their King." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's people (Israel) who have gone awhoring from Him must take upon themselves the shame of their apostasy and submit to the punishment of their iniquity. If God dealt with them according to the strict rigor of the law, He would have no more to do with them, but He will deal with them according to the multitude of His mercies, and not according to their iniquities. The remnant of Israel will yet seek the Lord and receive their King. 
Hos 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Charges against Israel for their sinfulness, idolatry and ignorance. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Hosea. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's controversy, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 17. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is a sad and sore judgment for men when God has to say, "let them alone" giving them up to their own heart's lust to walk in their own counsels until the measure of their iniquity is filled. Man's doings will surely return upon him, and his sins against God will be called over to him, either to his humiliation or to his condemnation. 
Hos 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's face withdrawn from Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.  <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's withdrawal, vv. 6, 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is a time when Jehovah will not be found when it is time for His judgments to fall on a rebellious, sinful people. He will take no notice of their troubles or prayers, until they become sensible of their guilt, and are brought to humble themselves before Him for it. 
Hos 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The voice of the remnant of Israel in the last days. Jehovah's  response.  <br><b>Characters</b> - God.  <br><b>Key Word</b> - Return, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 3, 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 1-3. This will be Israel's resolve in the last days, as the result of the "time of Jacob's trouble." The Lord Jesus will be to them as a refreshing rain after a long drought, and Israel shall be revived. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The consideration of God's judgments upon us because of sin should awaken us to return to God by repentance, prayer and reformation.  He who has smitten us will bind us up if we humbly return to Him. 
Hos 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's response to Israel's cry, continued. Israel's sad state. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.  <br><b>Key Word</b> - Wickedness, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If sinful souls are not healed and helped, but perish in their sin and misery, they cannot blame God, for He could and would have healed them. They are not healed because they will not be, refusing to look to God even when they are reaping the sore results of sin. Let all such remember that all their works are remembered and will have to be faced. 
Hos 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's response, continued. Sins denounced and captivity foretold. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.  <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sowing, reaping, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7 (a), 11. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who sow to the flesh must reap corruption. All the hopes of sinners are cheats, and their gains are snares. Those who break friendship with God make themselves an easy prey to all about them. 
Hos 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's response, continued. Israel's coming distress because of sin. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.  <br><b>Key Word</b> - Days of recompense, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 17. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Joy is a forbidden fruit to those who have broken covenant with God, until they return and make their peace with God. If men make things of the world and flesh their portion, it is just with God to deny them the comfort of them to bring man to a sense of his folly. The day  of recompense hastens on apace toward all who go a whoring from God. 
Hos 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's response, continued. Further reproof for Israel's impiety. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. Jareb, King of Israel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Chastisement, vv. 10, 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If the grace of God prevail not to destroy the love of sin in us, it is just that the providence of God should destroy the fuel of sin about us, and that what men have made idols of should be spoiled. Because God does not desire the ruin of sinners, He does desire their chastisement. 
Hos 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's response, continued. His tender love for Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's love, vv. 1, 4, 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 8, 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. These words have a double aspect, being applied to Christ (Matt. 2:15). They speak historically of the calling of Israel out of Egypt, and prophetically of the bringing of Christ from Egypt, the former being a type of the latter. Christ's calling out of Egypt is likewise a figure of the calling of all who are His out of spiritual slavery. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Though men who have had relationship with God are ripe for ruin because of following their own counsels, instead of God's, God is slow to anger, loth to abandon them, longing to draw them with the cords of His love. 
Hos 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's response, continued. Further reproof of Israel's sins. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Recompense, vv. 2, 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 9-10. As great an offense as Israel has been to God throughout the centuries, God's Word assures us that the prophecies regarding their restoration to glory in the earth will be certainly fulfilled in His own time. That time is connected with the time of Christ's Second Coming. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who make creatures and things their confidence, put a cheat upon their own souls, and prepare vexation for themselves. God has His eye even upon the merchant weighing his goods, and knows his methods and the idols of his heart. If men put contempt upon God, God will let their neighbors look with contempt upon them. 
Hos 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's response, continued. Israel's ruin. Ultimate blessing in the kingdom age. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Ruined (vv. 8, 16), ransomed (14). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4,- 6, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 9-11. God will yet give Israel a King, whom they will receive as God-appointed, a Saviour to their nation. Israel, becoming weary of the theocracy, or divine government, rejected Samuel, crying, "Give us a king." God gave them a king and plenty of trouble with him. Christ is the true heavenly King, and He will at His Second Coming take the throne of His father David. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Worldly prosperity, which feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God, and sends them on a downhill course in which they cannot easily stop themselves. Those whom God has in vain endured with longsuffering, and appealed to with much affection, will finally be made the vessels of His wrath. 
Hos 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Entreaty and promise to Israel. Restoration foretold. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Backsliding healed, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 5-7. God will yet be as the dew unto Israel, refreshing them with His comforts, but not until they see it descending upon them in the person of Jesus Christ, their rejected King, when He comes in the clouds of heaven with great glory. Then their branches indeed shall spread, and they shall grow as the vine. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Though backslidings from God are dangerous diseases of the soul, yet they are not incurable, for God graciously promises that if backsliders will return to be reconciled to Him and to His whole will, He will heal their backslidings and make them conscious of His love. 
Joe 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Joel's warnings of desolation upon Israel, and call to repentance. The plague of insects. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Destruction, v. 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - This prophecy looks for its complete fulfillment to the endtime of the present age (Rev. 14, 16, 19). Joel gives the fullest view of the consummation of all written prophecy concerning Israel's woes and final glory under Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who will not be aroused out of their security by the Word of God will finally be aroused by His rod, for He has the meanest of His creatures at His command, and if He pleases can humble and mortify a rebellious people by the most contemptible creatures. Even locusts become as lions when armed with a divine commission. 
Joe 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Day of vengeance upon Israel. Invading hosts and awful scourges. Repentance of the Jewish remnant and Jehovah's response and deliverance. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Joel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Day of the Lord, vv. 1, 31. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 28, 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 28. This has a partial and continuous fulfillment during "the last days" (Heb. 1:2), which began with the first advent of Christ (Acts 2:17), but the greater fulfillment awaits the "last days" as applied to Israel, when Christ shall come to be recognized as Lord of Lords and King of Kings. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is a great and terrible day of the Lord coming upon the world, to be ushered in with wonders in heaven and earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke. Woe to those who are not prepared for that day when it comes unawares upon them. Those who are able to pass through it will be given a change of heart through the universal outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and God will reign gloriously in all the universe, restoring to great favor in the earth the remnant of Israel. 
Joe 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Restoration of Israel, and judgment of all nations in regard to Israel. Pull kingdom blessings under Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Joel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Day of the Lord, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14, 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. All nations that wrong the Jews lay themselves open to God's vengeance, especially those in the last days who persecute the Jews. The coming of Christ will be the day of decision for them. The remnant of Israel will then be cleansed and restored, Jerusalem once more being made a praise in the earth. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Though God has suffered the enemies of His people (Israel) to prevail very far and for a long time, they will, in the day of decision, be called to account for it. To those who have repented and looked toward God as their salvation, that day will be a joyful day, for the Lord will be the strength of Israel, and all the earth shall be filled with the knowl- edge of Him thereafter.  
Amo 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Judgments pronounced upon surrounding peoples Syria, Tyre, Edom, Ammon.  <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Amos, Uzziah, Jeroboam, Hazael, Benhadad. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Punishment, vv. 6, 9, 11, 13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The God of Israel is the God of all the earth, and the nations that refuse to worship Him, and who persecute His people will be made to know that they are accountable to Him as Judge. 
Amo 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Judgments pronounced upon Judah, Moab and Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Amos. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Punishment, vv. 1, 4, 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - To keep not the commandments of God's Word, making no conscience of them, is to despise the wisdom, justice and goodness of the Author. Those who will not submit to the convictions of the Word will have to sink under the weight of God's punishments. 
Amo 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's controversy with Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Amos. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Punishment, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3, 6. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Judgment begins at the house of God. The nearer men are to God in profession, and the kinder notice God has taken of them, the more quickly and severely will He reckon with them if they by wilful sin disgrace their relation to Him. We cannot expect God to act for us unless we are reconciled to Him. 
Amo 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Threatening against the oppressors in Israel. Israel reminded of God's chastening in the past. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's stubbornness, vv. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12 (b), 13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God designs all His providential rebukes to influence men to turn to Him. The reason God sends worse troubles is because former and lesser troubles have not done their work. If men continue obstinate, they force God to do what He does not willingly do, but what is necessary to bring men to their senses. 
Amo 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - God's lamentation over Israel and captivity foretold. The day of the Lord. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lamentation, vv. 1, 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9, 14, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 22-23. Religious ceremonies are of no account with God, except as they express from the heart that for which they stand. "No man cometh to the Father but by Christ." Those ceremonies designed to set forth Christ are an abomination to God if the offerer does not from the heart recognize Christ in them and yield himself to Him. Though ritual sacrifices may be dispensed with, spiritual sacrifices in Christ cannot. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If men will not take a right course to obtain the favor of God, God will take an effectual course to make them feel the weight of His displeasure. Our transgressions do not pass Him unobserved, and He knows all hypocrisy in worship, and the punishment will be in proportion to the profession made. 
Amo 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Woe pronounced upon those at ease in sin abandoned by God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Woe, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1 (a). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Many are puffed up and rocked to sleep in carnal security by the position they occupy in the world set upon their own pleasure and careless of the afflictions of others. Those who thus give themselves to mirth when God calls them to mourning will find it a sin that will be punished with terrible woes. 
Amo 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Threatening judgments. The prophet's intercession no longer to prevail. Amos charged before the king and his answer. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Amos, Amaziah, Jeroboam. <br><b>Key Word</b> - God-abandoned, v. 8. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's patience, which has long been sinned against, will at length be sinned away for to be often reprieved yet never reclaimed; often reduced to straits, yet never brought to God is a great insult to God and merits His rejection. Those who have faithfully declared the counsel of God may expect to be misrepresented as enemies, and often by men in high religious standing. 
Amo 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The basket of summer fruit foretelling Israel's near ruin. Summary of the case against Israel. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Amos. <br><b>Key Word</b> - The end, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7 ( b ) , 1 1 . <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The time of God's patience draws surely to a conclusion, and if men do not make an end of sin, God will make an end of them, even though they be His professing people. To continually trample under foot the Word of God will end in a famine of the Word of God, which in a time of trouble will be the sorest judgment. 
Amo 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Final prophecy of dispersion of Israel and their ultimate restoration and blessing in the kingdom age. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Amos. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's sifting, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 10, 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 11-15. The bringing again of dispersed Israel to their own land is the sure promise of God's Word. In the coming Kingdom ofi Christ, the Messiah, Israel shall take deep root in the world, never to be rooted out of it. They shall find in Him the happiness and rest they have so long sought, and God's favor shall again be with them to give abundance of all good things. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The sword of war is the sword of divine vengeance, for God will thoroughly sift His people who ignore His constant pleadings. Evil is often nearest those who put it at the greatest distance from them (v. 10). 
Oba 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Edom's humiliation because of sin against God's people. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Obadiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Edom, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 17. Following the day of recompense, for which Christ is coming to the earth, the promise of deliverance and holiness for the people shall be fulfilled. The kingdoms of the world shall then become the kingdoms of the Lord and His Christ, who will take to Himself great power, and reign. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If men in their pride and carnal security dare to challenge omnipotence, their challenge will be taken up, and God will promptly lay them low. God will not suffer men to be puffed up by the humiliation of His people, nor to gloat over them in their afflictions. 
Jon 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jonah's commission and effort to avoid God's will. Swallowed by a great fish. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jonah, seamen. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fleeing prophet v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Typically Jonah foreshadows Israel out of their own land, a trouble to the Gentiles, cast out but miraculously preserved. In the future, in their hour of deep distress, they will cry out to God, will be delivered and will go forth to the Gentiles as originally commanded, announcing the kingdom of Christ at hand and His Second Coming. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Men may be distinctly called of God to proclaim His message, yet refuse to obey, but indisposition to preach will not rid one of the obligation to preach. God will send His storms to teach the wisdom of obedience. 
Jon 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jonah's prayer out of the depths and its answer. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jonah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prayer v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 7, 8, 9(b). <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. Israel swallowed up by the Gentiles in the sea of the nations must go down to the "bottom" before they will cry out to God and look to the one they pierced as their Saviour. When that hour comes, the nations will vomit them out upon their own land, where they will come face to face with Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Though we bring affliction upon ourselves by our sins, yet if we pray in humility and godly sincerity, we shall be heard at the throne of grace and God will speak the word of deliverance. 
Jon 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jonah's second commission. Ninevah's repentance because of his obedience. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jonah, King of Nineveh. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Repentance, vv. 8, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. God is unchangeable in character, but He may change His conduct toward men as they change their attitude toward Him. Repentance in man is a change of will. Repentance in God is God willing a change. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who would not destroy their souls must afflict their souls. God threatens so He will not have to punish, and makes His judgments conditional upon true repentance. There is mercy for those who will, before it is too late, confess and forsake their sin. 
Jon 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jonah's displeasure over God's action toward Nineveh. The sheltering gourd. Characters: God, Jonah. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jonah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Displeased, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 2(b). <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Jonah (Matt. 12:40) is used as an illustrious type of Christ who was buried and arose (1 Cor. 15:4) after three days. As God prepared Jonah's grave, so He prepared Christ's. Both were buried in order to their rising again for the bringing of the doctrine of repentance to the Gentile world. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Though there be those who find it in their hearts to quarrel with the goodness of God and His sparing, pardoning mercy to others (to which we all owe it that we are out of hell), yet God will justify Himself in the methods of His grace toward repenting sinners. As God values a human soul, so should we look upon it as worth more than all the world. 
Mic 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's case against Israel. Impending judgment. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Micah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Incurable, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 6-16. describes the Syrian invasion. This gives rise to the prophecy of the greater invasion in the last days (4:9-13), and of Christ's deliverance at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14; 19:17). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There conies a time when men who have persisted in sin must face ruin without remedy. God cannot help them because they will not by repentance and reformation help themselves. 
Mic 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's case against Israel, continued. Future deliverance of a remnant. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sore destruction, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 13. Christ is the King who will, after the great Armageddon, pass before Israel to bring them into the land of their rest. While there is in this age an election out of Israel, the promises of restoration to the land here given will only have their accomplishment at Christ's Second Coming. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Sinners cannot expect to rest in a land which they have polluted by their sins against God, for He will certainly cause it to spew them out with terrible judgments. With every threatening of judgment, however, there is a promise of mercy for a remnant who will acknowledge their King and walk in His ways. 
Mic 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Coming judgments of the captivities. The priests and prophets rebuked.  <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, princes, prophets. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's sin, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Men cannot expect to do ill and fare well simply because they are recognized as religious. The time will come when those who have shown no mercy shall have judgment without mercy, for God will hide His face when they are sorely in need of His favor. 
Mic 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The future kingdom of Christ on earth and Israel's happy regathering. Battle of Armageddon. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Mountain of the Lord, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 1, 2. A mountain in Scripture is a symbol of great earth power (Dan. 2:35). The ultimate establishment of Christ's earthly kingdom is here foretold. Christ will be the King (v. 7) to protect and govern it and to order its affairs for the best to the end of time. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In the last days of the age, the Kingdom of Christ shall be manifested in the earth with a lustre no earth kingdom has ever had. It will be a kingdom universal, peaceful, prosperous, and of the increase of Christ's government, and peace there shall be no end. Israel, long dispersed and cast off, will have a place of glory in the earth, recognizing Christ as King and Lord. 
Mic 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The birth and rejection of Christ foretold. His ultimate eternal <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's ruler (Christ), v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 4. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - . v. 2. See Isa. 7:13, 14; 9:6, 7. Note that the "child" was born in Bethlehem, but the "Son" was "from everlasting." Christ was pre-existent, else He could not have by His atonement made propitiation for the sin of the world.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Christ, who existed from eternity as Son of God, was to be born into the world as the child of woman, to be the Saviour of the world.   Rejected, except by a remnant, He would await the consummation of the age, when He will be given a kingdom glorious to Himself; happy for His subjects; disastrous to sinners. 
Mic 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's controversy with Israel's past and present. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Omri, Ahab, Balak, Balaam. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Controversy, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 7, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. Sacrifices and ceremonies have their value from the reference they have to Christ, the great propitiation, but if the believer disregards their meaning, they are an abomination. Thousands of rams and rivers of oil cannot take the place of one little stream of the blood of Christ, the power of which is truly appropriated to the heart. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God issues a challenge to all who have ever professed belief in Him, but have wandered from Him, to testify against Him, if they have found His demands unreasonable, or if He has not fully paid His accounts. If our ceremonies be accepted of Him, they must be backed by lives conformed to His will and in communion with Him, for He cannot be deceived by external ceremonies. If professors of religion ruin themselves by sin, it will be the most terrible of any ruin. 
Mic 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Israel's sad present condition. The voice of the remnant in the last days. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Micah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - God, my salvation, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 9, 18, 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 19. The gracious God is ready, because of the sacrifice of His Son, to pardon and pass over the iniquity of His people upon their repentance and turning to Him. Let the pardoned sinner remember that if he has not been dealt with according to his deserts, it is because Jesus Christ bore his sins on the cross, and made it possible for God to put His sins in the depths of the sea. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When a child of God has much occasion to cry "Woe is me" when it seems that all flesh has corrupted their way it is a great comfort that he has a God to look to, in whom there is rejoicing and satisfaction always. He cannot but marvel at God's pardoning mercy to men and rejoice at the promise that He shall yet reign supreme in the earth. 
Nah 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's holiness and power. Nineveh's destruction forecasted. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Nahum. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vengeance, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. These words are quoted by the apostle both from Isaiah and Nahum, and applied to the great redemption wrought by the Lord Jesus and the publishing of His gospel to the world (Romans 10:15). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against His enemies, and His favor and mercy are assured to His faithful, loyal subjects. His mighty power makes His wrath very terrible and His favor very desirable. 
Nah 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The battle in the streets of Nineveh. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.<br><b>Key Word</b> - Nineveh emptied, vv. 10, 2. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God has a quarrel with those who have done violence to His people, and when the measure of their iniquity is filled up, He will fill them with terror, while the fire of His indignation shall utterly consume all in which they have placed their confidence. 
Nah 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Nineveh reaps what it has sown destruction and violence. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, King of Assyria. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Woe, v. 1. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The great lesson of Nahum is that the character of God makes Him not only a stronghold to all who trust Him, but One who "will not at all acquit the wicked." He can be "just and yet the justifier of him which pelieveth in Jesus" (Romans 3:26), but only because His law has been fully vindicated in the cross. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The people that have with their cruelties been a terror and destruction to others, will eventually have terror and destruction brought home to them. They are but preparing to themselves terrible enemies against the day of their own fall. 
Hab 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Habakkuk's prayer concerning evil in dispersed Israel. God's voice to Israel and Habakkuk's testimony to God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Habakkuk. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's iniquity, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 5. Acts 13:37-41 interprets this prediction of the redemptive work of Christ with Israel in dispersion. God did "work a work" which Israel did not believe. Paul quoted this to the Jews of the dispersion in the synagogue at Antioch. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We must not think it strange if God sometimes suffers wickedness to prevail far and to prosper long, for He has good reasons for His attitude, and He cannot be the author or patron of sin. He takes full account of all sin committed, and will surely make men answer for it in His own time. 
Hab 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's response to Habakkuk's testimony. Vision of coming woes.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Habakkuk. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Woe, vv. 9, 12, 15, 19. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 12, 14, 15, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. Isa. 11:9 fixes the time when the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord when the Righteous Branch of David, Christ, has come and set up His kingdom. The knowledge of the "glory" of the Lord cannot be until He is manifested in glory (Matt. 24:30; 25:31; Luke 9:26; 2 Thess. 1:7; 2:8; Jude 14). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye and the pride of life are the entangling snare of men, which, if yielded to, bring woes upon them. Those who will not be taught the knowledge of God's glory by the judgments of His mouth will be made to bear the judgments of His hand. 
Hab 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Habakkuk's answer of faith to Jehovah. The terror of God's wrath against sinners. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Habakkuk. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's wrath, vv. 2, 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2(b), 18, 19. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The God of nature can alter and control all the powers of nature to make earth, sea and heavenly bodies carry out the purposes of His judgment against sinners, or for the salvation of His people. His true children can, in the midst of earth's distresses, rejoice in Him who is the God of their eternal salvation, since by them, their salvation cannot be hindered but only furthered. 
Zep 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Coming judgment on Judah prefiguring the coming day of the Lord. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Zephaniah, Josiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Day of wrath, v. 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 7, 14. The day of the Lord here is a small specimen of the great "day" that is to come, in which all earth judgments will culminate, to be followed by Israel's restoration and blessing under Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who will not improve the presence of God with them as a Father, may expect His presence with them as a Judge, to call them to account for all their contempt of His grace. The day of His wrath will strip sinners of all that they have and will leave them nothing but distress and pain with no way of helping themselves. 
Zep 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Call to remnant of Israel in the day of the Lord. Judgment threatened upon Assyria, Philistia and other nations. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's anger, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. The only safe hiding place from the wrath of God against sin is the righteousness of Christ (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 10:1-3). To be "hid with Christ in God" (Col. 3:2) is to be in the chambers of safety. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The nations that rebel against the precepts of God's Word have the threatenings of His Word against them, and the effect will be no less than their total destruction in the day of His fierce anger. It concerns each one to make it sure to themselves that they shall be hid in the day of God's wrath, in a hiding place of God's providing. 
Zep 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jerusalem's moral state in time of Zephaniah. The coming judgment of nations and kingdom blessing for restored Israel. , <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgment of nations, v. 8. (Kingdom blessing, 14-20.) <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. It is the Lord Jesus, the rejected and glorified King, who will be in the midst forever, to receive the homage of His subjects and to give out His favors. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The end of nations that have continued to he of the earth and of the devil, when Christ comes to set up His kingdom, shall be destruction. The reproach of Israel shall then be removed, and all who are permitted to enter that Kingdom will have occasion, with all their hearts, to eternally rejoice in Him, for God will have forever removed calamities from them, the noise of war will be silenced, sinful nature put under control and God and His Christ made all in all. 
Hag 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's chastening because of the interrupted work on His house. The work on the temple recommenced. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Darius, Haggai, Zerubbabel, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Temple, vv. 2, 14.  <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those are strangers to their own interests who prefer the conveniences and ornaments of the temporal life before the carrying on of God's work in the community. If we would have the real comfort and continuance of temporal enjoyments, we should make God our friend by putting His interests first, otherwise that which we gain is put into a bag with holes. 
Hag 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The various temples. Chastening because of priest's impurity and the peoples' delay. Future destruction of Gentile power. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Haggai, Zerubbabel, Joshua. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's house, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7, 8, 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. Christ is the desire of all nations, for in Him shall all the families of the earth be blessed with the best of blessings. The shaking of nations will take place in the great Tribulation, which will be followed by Christ's coming in glory. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If we take no care of the interests of God's work, we cannot expect that He should take care of all our interests. If we are employed in His work, we should be jealous over ourselves, lest we spoil it by going about it with unsanctified hearts and hands. 
Zec 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Zechariah's symbolic visions, warning of Jehovah's displeasure with the nations. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Darius, Zechariah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's displeasure, vv. 2, 12, 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 17. The visions reveal Judah in dispersion, Jerusalem under adverse possession, and the Gentile nations at rest about it, the conditions that have prevailed throughout the present age. God's answer to the angel's intercession sweeps on to the end time, when the Lord shall yet comfort by the return of Christ in glory. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The judgments of God which those who went before us were under should be taken as warnings not to tread in their steps. A speedy reformation, while the mercy of God is extended, is the only way to prevent an approaching ruin. 
Zec 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Visions of Zechariah. Jerusalem in the kingdom age. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Zechariah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jerusalem, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 10, 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 11. He whom the Lord of Hosts will send in the latter days to dwell among men can be no other than the Lord Jesus. All nations will at that time own Him as the one sent of Jehovah, which was not fulfilled in His first coming. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jerusalem is the apple of Jehovah's eye, jealously guarded by His angels and marked out for a glorious place in the earth in the day when Christ returns to dwell among men upon the earth. 
Zec 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Visions of Zechariah. Joshua and Satan before the angel of the Lord. Jehovah's servant, The Branch. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Joshua, Satan, Zechariah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Garments, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 7. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 8. Christ is the "Servant, the Branch," who was long hid, but in the fulness of time was brought forth into the world. His beginning was as a tender branch, but He will yet become a great tree filling the earth. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - By the guilt of our sins we are obnoxious to God's justice, and by the power of our sins we are odious to His holiness. Those who would belong to Christ will be enabled to cast off the filthy rags of corrupt affections and lusts, and will be clothed with the spotless robe of His righteousness. Only such* can He place in positions of honor and trust in His service. 
Zec 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the golden candlestick and two olive trees. Zerubbabel designated to finish the temple. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Zechariah, Zerubbabel, Joshua, the angel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Temple's completion, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6 (b). <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. Some think Christ and the Holy Spirit are here meant. From Christ, the olive tree, by the Spirit, the olive branch, all the golden oil of grace is communicated to believers.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God will carry on and complete His work, not by human might or power, but by the power of His Spirit, working in those designated and called by Him. For those thus called, all difficulties shall be gotten over. 
Zec 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the flying roll and the ephah.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Zechariah, angel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Curse, v. 3. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's holy law reveals the righteous wrath of God against those who by swearing, affront God's majesty and who by stealing, set aside  their neighbor's rights. 
Zec 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the four chariots. The symbolic crowning of Joshua. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Zechariah, angel, Joshua, Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, Josiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - The Branch, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 13. Christ is now a Priest, but still in the holiest within the veil (Lev. 16:15; Heb. 9:11-14, 24), seated on the Father's throne (Rev. 3:21). He will yet sit upon His own throne (Heb. 9:28), a Priest  upon His throne. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Following the day when God's judgments go forth to all the earth, Christ shall be manifested in His kingdom glory as the Priest-King on His own throne. 
Zec 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The mission from Babylon, and Jehovah's answer to the question of fasts. Why prayer was not answered.   <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Darius, Zechariah, Sherezer, Regemmelich. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fasts, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10, 13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When we offer up our requests to God, it must be with readiness to receive instructions from Him. God is not made men's debtor by fasts  which are not observed with self-examination and a purpose to put away their sins.  
Zec 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's unchanging purpose to restore Jerusalem and bless Israel in the Kingdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Zechariah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Zion's restoration, vv. 2, 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16, 17, 22, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - In the days after the coming of Christ in glory, Jerusalem will be made the center of earth's worship, and the Jew will be the missionary to all nations, bearing the messages of Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jerusalem, the city of God, and Israel, the people of God, have God to plead their cause until the day when the dispersion shall be ended, Israel again is made fruitful, and Jerusalem a praise in the earth. In that day all men shall honor a Jew as one of the chosen people of God. 
Zec 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Burden upon the cities surrounding Palestine. Christ presented as King-Savior in His first advent. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Zion's King, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 9. Having introduced the King, which was Christ in vv. 9-10, the verses which follow look to the end time and the kingdom when He will come in glory. Except in v. 9, the present age is not seen in Zechariah. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Christ, Israel's King, who came as the meek and lowly One, riding upon an ass, will yet be recognized by Israel, and will bring them deliverance, slay all enmities and extend His kingdom to all the earth. 
Zec 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The future strengthening of Judah and Ephraim. Israel's dispersion and regathering in one view. <br><b>Characters</b> - God.  <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's strengthening, vv. 6, 10, 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. It is Christ whom Israel will recognize as the crucified King, who will strengthen them, and cause them to bestir themselves to go up and down the land in His name. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God has a hand in all the events concerning Israel, and they shall finally have His favor and presence, being owned and accepted of Him. The people long dispersed shall be brought together, purified and strengthened in the Lord. 
Zec 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - First advent of Christ foretold and His rejection. God's wrath against Israel as the result. The rise of anti-Christ and his judgment. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Zechariah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's wrath, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. Beauty and Bands literally "graciousness and union" signifying God's attitude toward Israel in sending His Son (Matt. 21:37), and His purpose to reunite Israel (Ezek. 37:15-22). Christ in His first advent came with grace (John 1:17) to offer union (Matt. 4:17), but was sold for 30 pieces of silver (vv. 12, 13). Beauty (graciousness) was thereby "cut in sunder." Bands (union) was broken, God's purpose to reunite Israel being for this age abandoned. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who will not open the door to let the King in, but sell Him for a paltry price, will sooner or later have to open the door to let ruin in. (This is the desperate case of Israel in the present age.) 
Zec 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jerusalem's coming siege by the Beast and his armies. Deliverance of Judah by the Lord Himself. The Spirit poured out and the pierced One recognized. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Zechariah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jerusalem's deliverer, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. The pouring out of the Spirit upon all who receive the Crucified One as Lord and Saviour in the present age is an earnest of what Israel shall receive when Christ's Kingdom comes. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jerusalem, following the awful days of the end-time, shall be repeopled and replenished, but it will not be until Christ returning in glory is recognized by Israel as He whom they have pierced. He will put down all enemies and work a gracious work in His people. 
Zec 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Repentant remnant of Israel in the last days. Refined by great tribulation. Israel again restored to God's favor. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Zechariah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's refining, vv. 1, 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. The fountain opened is the pierced side of Jesus Christ, for thence came there out blood and water precious blood, the price of our redemption. Those who now look to Christ pierced are saved but  this Israel does not see and will not until His Second Coming (v. 6).  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Israel, at the end of the age, will pass through a period of fiery trial for purification, after which they will find Christ to be the Lamb slain for the putting away of sin. Their sin and uncleanness finally put away, they shall be restored to Jehovah's favor. 
Zec 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The return of Christ. Armageddon. The changes in Palestine. The kingdom established on earth. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Zechariah, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Kingdom, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 9, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 9. The prayer (Matt. 6:10) "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven," will have its final answer in the coming of the King in the power of His might. It will not be a spiritual and gradual coming, the effects of preaching, but a personal, literal coming in the clouds of heaven (v. 4). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In the last days, Christ shall return in glory, His feet touching in that day upon the Mount of Olives. All opposing powers shall be put down, Israel shall be gloriously established, Christ shall be owned by all as King and Lord forever, and all men will serve and worship in the beauty of holiness. 
Mal 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jehovah's love for Israel. The sins of the priests and hypocrisy of the people. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Malachi, Jacob, Esau. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jehovah's displeasure, vv. 10, 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God would have His people know that He loves them, therefore justly takes it very ill to have His favors slighted and His ordinances partaken of in hypocrisy. Those who come to holy ordinances irreverently, going away from them never the better, and under no concern, in effect say, "The table of the Lord is contemptible." 
Mal 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The message to the priests concerning their sins. The evils among the people. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Malachi. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel's abominations, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 10, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. Cp. Acts 17:24-29. The reference in both instances is to God as "Father of our spirits" or creation. It has no reference to salvation. "We are children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Woe to those appointed to be God's mouth to the people, but who instead are a stone of stumbling. All who rest in external performances of religion will not only come short of acceptance with God in them, but will be filled with shame and confusion. 
Mal 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Mission of John the Baptist, and Christ's first advent foretold. Israel exhorted to return to God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Malachi, John the Baptist. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Return, vv. 7, 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 10, 11, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. The first "messenger" is a prophecy of the appearing of the forerunner, John the Baptist (Matt. 11:10; Mark 1:2), which Isaiah had foretold (40:3). "The messenger of the covenant" is Christ Himself, but for its final fulfillment looks to the second coming of Christ, the messenger having been rejected at His first advent. His sudden coming to the temple, connected with judgment, awaits fulfillment (Heb. 2:20). Malachi, like other O. T. prophets, saw both advents of Messiah blended in one horizon, but not the separating interval. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who deny God His part of their estates may justly expect a curse upon their own part of them. Those who rob God rob themselves of His benefits and protection. In view of the immanence of Christ's coming, we should see to it that our accounts with God are balanced. 
Mal 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The day of the Lord and coming of Christ as "sun of righteousness." Elijah to be forerunner of the day of the Lord. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Moses, Elijah, Christ, Malachi. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Day of the Lord, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. The Old Testament closes with the promise of the rising of the "sun" of righteousness. The New Testament closes with the promise of the rising of the "morning star" (Rev. 22:16). The morning star precedes the coming of the sun, which finally ushers in the day. Christ is coming to the Church as the "morning star" in the last dark hours of the age (1 Thess. 4:13-16 prior to the great tribulation). At the close of the tribulation He is coming as the "sun" ushering in the Millennial day, and Israel's history will then be resumed. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The great day of the Lord is impending, a time of terror and destruction upon all whose hearts have been stout against God, but followed by the coming of Christ as the sun of righteousness with healing in His wings for all who have looked to Him. "Come quickly, Lord Jesus." 
Mat 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Generations of Jesus Christ. His conception and birth. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Joseph, Mary, generations of Christ from Abraham to David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Genealogy, vv. 1, 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 21, 22, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. See Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14, 8:8, 10; Mic. 5:2, 3. Jesus was not begotten of natural generation. Note v. 16, "Mary, of whom was born Jesus." A feminine form for the word "born" being used, indicates that Jesus was born of Mary, not of man. He was without a sinful nature, for the reason that He had the Holy Spirit for His Father. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ was, in accordance with the prophecies, conceived of the Holy Ghost, born of a virgin. He was both Son of Man and Son of God, thereby being qualified to save His people from their sins. 
Mat 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Visit of the Magi, flight into Egypt, Herod's slaughter of the innocents. Return of Joseph and Mary to Nazareth. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Joseph, Mary, Herod, chief priests, scribes, wise men, Archelaus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Star of Bethlehem, vv. 2, 9, 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 9, 10, 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. This is the first of 21 unsuccessful attempts on the life of Jesus which mark the enmity of Satan and his desire to cut Him off before His appointed work could be done. That enmity was manifested in O. T. times against the royal line, and now that Christ's sacrifice has been made, it is shown in the blinding of the hearts of men lest they see Him as their Savior, and against Christians that their testimony for Him might be hindered. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The light of the Scriptures and the light of nature are calculated to lead the seeking soul to Christ, the Savior. Those who follow their light to Him will find in Him joy unspeakable. Those who spurn their light will have in this life only dread of Him and hereafter naught but misery. 
Mat 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ministry of John the Baptist and baptism of Jesus. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, John. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Baptism, vv. 6, 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 16, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - When John announced (v. 2) the "kingdom of the heavens at hand," he announced that the Christian dispensation was the next thing <br><b>Conclusion</b> - To follow Jesus in the waters of baptism is to publicly acknowledge our separation from sin, determination to bring forth fruit unto God, and consecration to His service. 
Mat 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> -  Temptation of Jesus. Jesus' public ministry begun. Call of first  disciples.  <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Satan, John the Baptist, Peter, Andrew, James, John, Isaiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Temptation. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 6, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. It is sometimes asked "If Jesus was without a sinful nature, how could He be tempted?" May not a city be besieged, though impregnable? Acid will corrode some metals others it will not. The devil applied his test to Christ it did not corrode. Note comparison of Jesus' temptations with those of the first Adam. (1). Gen. 3:6 lust of the flesh (tree good for food); Jesus to turn stones into bread. (2). Lust of the eyes (tree pleasant to the eyes); Jesus glory of kingdoms of the earth to take them in a way not appointed by the Father. (3). Pride of the life (desiied to make one wise); Jesus to throw Himself from pinnacle to be hailed by crowds below as the long expected Messiah. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Word of God is the Sword of the Spirit, which if rightly handled, will deal defeat to Satan in his attempts to snare the believer by tempting suggestions. Beware of Satanic twisting of Scripture "rightly divide the Word of Truth." 
Mat 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sermon on the mount. Beatitudes. Believer as salt and light. Christ's relation to the law. Divorce. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sermon on the Mount, vv. 1, 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3-16, 18, 28, 32, 39, 44, 48. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. Some teach that the teachings of the sermon on the mount are applicable only to the future earthly kingdom of Christ, not the present age, and as such are postponed until Christ's second coming. However we think of the "kingdom of the heavens" as the church age, during which Christ, through regeneration, is peopling the heavens, and these principles seem to have clearer application to the present age than to that time when righteousness shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The relationship of a child of God will be manifested in the world by his shining and burning as a light for Christ, by his quiet and savory influence in society, and by his conformity to the Word of God in all things. 
Mat 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sermon on the Mount, continued. Formalism condemned. The new revelation of prayer (disciples prayer). The law of riches. Cure of anxiety. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sermon on the Mount, 5:2. Prayer, 6:5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 6, 8, 9-13, 19, 20, 21, 33, 34. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 8-13. Rather than the "Lord's prayer," this should be designated as "the diciple's prayer," for Jesus could not pray this prayer as the expression of His own needs. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - True relationship to God will be manifested by a motive of heart devotion to God back of all charity to men, by absolute sincerity and humility in the prayer life, by laying up heavenly treasures and by absolute confidence in the Heavenly Father to supply all real needs and overcome all troubling circumstances. 
Mat 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sermon on the Mount, continued. Encouragement to prayer. The two ways. Warnings against false teachers. Danger of profession without faith. The two foundations. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sermon on the Mount, 5:2. (Two ways, vv. 13, 24, 26.) <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 7, 8, 12, 15, 21, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 22 shows that there will be among those rejected by Christ in the last days, many preachers, so-called soul winners and good moral men, simply because devoid of true faith in Christ who alone is the foundation of salvation. Beware of mere lip-devotion which signifies nothing, either here or hereafter. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - True disciples of Christ will be men and women cautious in their judgment of others; conscious of their own faults; confident and earnest in prayer; wary of false teachers and hypocritical profession; building all eternal hopes upon the firm Rock, faith in the Word of God and Christ Jesus. 
Mat 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus heals a leper, the centurion's servant and Peter's wife's mother. Professed disciples tested. Stilling of the waves. Casting-out demons at Gadara. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, leper, centurion and his servant, Peter's mother-in-law, two men of Gadara, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sovereign Christ, vv. 17, 27. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13 (a), 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 29. Men may deny the deity of Christ, but demons know better. His divine Sonship is proven amply by the demonstration of His power in all spheres. He was not only Son of God, but Son of Man (vv. 20, 24) and having been subjected to all human testings, He became a perfect sacrifice and substitute for the believer on the Cross. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus is the divine Son of God, sovereign over all physical ailments, over all circumstances, over the powers of nature, over the evil emissaries of Satan and over sin (9:5). Faith takes Him at His word and finds rest and deliverance at all times in His Word of power. 
Mat 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Healing of the palsied man. Call of Matthew. Answering the Pharisees. Healing of woman with issue of blood. Daughter of a ruler raised from the dead. Two blind men healed. A demon cast out. Preaching and healing in Galilee. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, palsied man, sick woman, Jairus, his daughter, Matthew. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Power, vv. 6, 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, ,12, 13, 37, 38. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. Either Christ was the Son of God with power to forgive sins and those who claim He is a mere man with no such power, are themselves blasphemers or else He was, as they charged, a blasphemer. His deity is fully established by His deliverances from sin, and the consciousness of forgiveness which He has given to millions of people throughout the age. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All power is given unto Jesus Christ, both in heaven and in earth. Degradation and disease, demons and death are subject to His rebuke, and faith in Him is the most priceless treasure on earth, vv. 2, 22, 29. 
Mat 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The twelve instructed and sent out. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Peter, Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James, Thaddaeus, Simon, Judas. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Calling and enduement, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16, 24, 25, 28, 30, 32, 33, 37, 38, 42. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 32. Confession of Christ is the normal answer of a new born soul to God. "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." To evidence the sincerety of our faith by boldly witnessing for Him gives us One in heaven who speaks a good word to the Father for us. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The call of Jesus to His service is His enabling for that service. He stands with His servants in all their trials, takes notice of every insult they are called upon to endure, honors them in this life for their witness of Him and will abundantly reward them in the next life for all their faithfulness. No cross, no crown. No gall, no glory. 
Mat 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Answer to questions sent Jesus by John the Baptist. Judgment predicted as result of rejection of Christ. Rest for individuals who put their trust in Him. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, John the Baptist. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Offended in Christ, vv. 6, 19, 25. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 25, 28, 29, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 28. This is a pivotal point in the ministry of Jesus. The Savior-King being spurned by the Jews, now offers rest and service to all who are conscious of their need. To these He will GIVE rest (peace with God, Rom. 5:1, the rest of salvation), and in His service they shall continually FIND rest (the peace of God, Phil. 4:7). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The miracles of Christ are the seal of heaven upon Him, evincing His divine commission, and proving to this day the truth of His doctrine. Those who will not be prejudiced against Him nor scandalized in Him, cannot but be blessed in Him. Those who will be yoked with Him in His burdens, will by Him, be lifted out of all their burdens. 
Mat 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus announces Himself Lord of Sabbathy Controversy wijth Pharisees. Healing of the withered hand. A demoniac healed. The unpardonable sin. Death and resurrection foretold. Deficiency of selfreformation. Jesus' new relationships. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Holy Spirit, Pharisees, disciples, man with withered hand, Satan, David, Jonah, Queen of the South. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lord of Sabbath, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 30, 32, 36, 50. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The Sabbath (v. 1) commemorates a finished creation. The Lord's day (see v. 40) commemorates a finished redemption, for Christ arose from the grave on the first day. The seventh day was a day of legal obligation. The first day is a day of voluntary worship. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ is Lord of the Sabbath day, giving us the true example of the acceptable use of that day, spending it with and for God. Ascribing the word which Christ does in the power of the Holy Spirit to Satan, is a sin unpardonable here or hereafter. 
Mat 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven. The sower, tares and wheat, grain of mustard seed, leaven, hid treasure, pearl, drag net. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, disciples, Satan, Isaiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Kingdom mysteries, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 41, 42. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Some make the parables of the mustard seed and the leaven to teach the conversion of the whole world in this age by the preaching of the gospel. This view is explicitly contradicted by Jesus' interpretation of the parables of the wheat and tares and the drag net therefore there is something wrong with the popular interpretation of the leaven and mustard seed. Leaven means "corruption" and is always used in Scripture as a symbol of evil. The mustard seed parable pictures an abnormal and unsubstantial growth of the outward church. See Dan. 4:20-22. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The present age will be marked to its end by the presence of both professors of religion and possessors sinners and saints. The believer's work is to sow the Word of God in faith, not expecting thereby to convert the whole world, but in expectation of Him, who at the end of the age, will come with His angels to separate the good and the bad to make an end of sinners and set up His glorious Kingdom. 
Mat 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Herod's troubled conscience and the murder of John the Baptist. The 5000 fed. Jesus walks on the water. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, John the Baptist, Herod, Herodias, and her daughter, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lord of nature, vv. X8, 25, 33. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 18, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Note v. 33. The sure cure for the Unitarian belief about Christ, is to be out on a boisterous sea where no human power can help, and then see Him come forth to quiet the boisterous winds and save the sinking soul. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - That will be multiplied and blessed to the service of men which is by faith passed through the hands of Christ. Faith and love with little can do much. (v. 18.) The steps of faith fall on a seeming void but always find a rock. No sea is too rough on which to venture if the eyes are on Christ and He has bidden us "come" (vv. 29, 30). 
Mat 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Scribes and Pharisees rebuked. Syrophonecian's daughter healed. The multitude healed. 4000 fed. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Peter, (disciples), Syrophonecian woman, her daughter. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Hypocrites, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 28. This was the first time the rejected Christ ministered to a Gentile (cf. Matt. 12:18). When a Gentile addressed Him as "Son of David" (v. 22) He made no reply, but when she acknowledged Him as "Lord," He answered immediately (v. 25). The Gentile has no claim under the covenant rights and promises of Israel. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Christian life is not a label to put on, but a life to be put in; not a system of doctrine to be quibbled about but a great principle to be lived out. Genuine faith overcomes all obstacles. His compassion meets all needs. 
Mat 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus' rebuke of bl'nd Pharisees. The symbol of leaven interpreted. Peter's confession of the deity of Jesus. Jesus foretells His death and resurrection. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Peter, Satan, disciples, John the Baptist, Elias, Jeremiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Deity (v. 16); Death (v. 21); Resurrection (vv. 4, 21); Descent (v. 27). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 24, 26. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Note vv. 17, 18. Jesus does not here infer that the church was to be built upon Peter but upon Himself, as just confessed by Peter (v. 16) (Cf. 1 Peter 2:4-9). In the Greek, the word "Petra" is in feminine form, denoting that the reference was not to Peter, but to his confession. The deity of Christ is the foundation doctrine of Christianity. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus is the Son of God, the foundation stone of the church. He died for the sin of the world, arose for the justification of the believer and is coming back in glory to reward His own. The cross of Calvary was God's program for Him, essential for the salvation of men and all attempts to turn Him from it were Satan-inspired (as are all denials of its necessity today). 
Mat 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The transfiguration of Jesus Christ. The powerless disciples, unable to heal a lunatic, and the mighty Christ. Resurrection again foretold. Miracle of the tribute money. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Moses, Elijah, Peter, James, John, a father and his lunatic son, John the Baptist, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Transfiguration, v. 2. Faith, v. 20. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The transfiguration is the answer to v. 28 of the preceding chapter. In it, we see in miniature, the elements of the coming earthly Kingdom of Christ. Jesus in His glory (v. 2); Moses standing for believers who have passed on through death (v. 3) ; Elijah representing those who will be translated (v. 3. Cf. 1 Thess. 4:14-17); Three disciples representing Israel in the flesh at His coming; Gentiles at foot of mountain for the living nations. It was given just following the announcement which disappointed the disciples, His rejection and death, and was for their encouragement. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ is sealed of heaven as the beloved Son of God, glorious and mighty in His person, possessed of all power in heaven and earth, the Victor over death and the grave, yet to reign in glory. Genuine faith in Him and yieldedness to His power, moves the arm of omnipotence. 
Mat 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sermon on the child text. Discipline in the church. Unity in prayer. Law of forgiveness. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Peter. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Greatness, v. 1. Forgiveness, v. 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 11, 19, 20, 21, 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 20. Where His saints are, there is the sanctuary of Christ. While as to His person He is in heaven, His Spirit is with our spirits, and He is the central figure in every gathering for prayer in His name. Not a multitude, but faith and sincere devotion on the part of worshippers, even though there be but two or three, invites His presence and the manifestation of His power among them. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those are truly great who are truly humble and good, and God is pleased with those who multiply their pardons of others, even as they have many times been pardoned by Him. 
Mat 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christ and the divorce question. Little children blessed. The rich young ruler. Apostles' future place in the Kingdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Peter, rich young ruler. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Divorce, v. 7. Riches, v. 24. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 9, 14, 24, 26 (b), 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 16, 17. It is not implied that Jesus was not good (John 8:46; 14:30), but that He would not be called "good" by one who did not accept His deity, but looked upon Him merely as a man (Master "teacher") and put himself on the same level (v. 20). As God (v. 17) He is the expression of all good. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God Himself instituted the relationship between husband and wife, and those joined together by the ordinance of God are not to be put asunder by an ordinance of man, except for fornication. Nothing less than the almighty grace of God can enable a man taken up with the riches of this world to get into heaven. Riches, if they are under our feet, are stepping stones, but if upon our backs, are a curse. 
Mat 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parables of laborers in the vineyard. Jesus' death and resurrection again foretold. Ambitious requests of James and John. Healing of the two blind men. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, wife of Zebedee, James, John, two blind men. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Service, vv. 1, 27. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16, 26, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 18, 19. The death of Jesus Christ was not, as some say, the result of His being the victim of circumstances too strong for Him, but was the result of His own program. He came (v. 28) to give His life a ransom. He did not die as a martyr, but as a Victor. He never foretold His death without adding that He would be resurrected. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - One hour's service in the spirit of humble trust will be as abundantly rewarded as 12 hours of legal service where reward is sought as a matter of debt. The way to true greatness is to be humble and serviceable with an eye continually to the great pattern servant, Jesus, who came 
Mat 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The triumphant entry. Jesus' second purification of the temple. Barren fig tree cursed. Jesus' authority questioned. Parable of the two sons in the vineyard. Parable of the house-holder demanding fruit from his vineyard. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, John, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Triumphal entry, vv. 9, 10. Jesus' authority, v. 23. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13, 21, 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. A colt is a symbol of peace. In Jesus' second coming He will come upon a war horse (Rev. 19). Cf. v. 44. The flippant attitude of the people toward Jesus in His first presentation was due to their conception of Him as expressed in v. 11. When He comes in power, there will be no room for doubt of the fact that He is both King and Judge. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus the King-Savior was officially offered to Israel first. He was acclaimed by an unthinking multitude who thought He would then set up His earth kingdom, but He was soon rejected by official representatives of the nation. Nevertheless His rejection by His own people turned to the riches of the Gentiles. The unbelief of sinners is their ruin. 
Mat 22:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parable of the marriage feast. Jesus' answer to the Herodians. Sadducees and Pharisees. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, lawyer. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Unworthy guests, vv. 8, 12, 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9,21,37,38,39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The invitation to the marriage feast first extended to Israel (v. 7), was greeted with violence and the King fulfilled the latter part of the verse in A. D. 70. The world-wide call then went forth (Matt. 28:16-20; v. 9) to "as many as would receive" (John 1:12). The man without a wedding garment pictures those who think to be accepted in their own righteousness rather than the righteousness of Jesus Christ Rom 10:1-3; Isa. 64:6; Phil. 3:9. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The gospel call bids all to the great marriage feast. Some wickedly reject Christ's invitations. Some think to intrude in the rags of their hypocrisy (See Rom. 3:22) but the humble gladly accept and are satisfied. It is not wit and reason that makes one acceptab/e to God, but humble acceptance of His call and partaking of the feast He has provided. 
Mat 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus denounces woes upon the Pharisees for their hypocrisy. His lament over Jerusalem. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Hypocrites, v. 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 11, 12, 37, 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 39. There are three "untils" to be accomplished before Israel can have full blessing. 1. v. 39. 2. Luke 21: 24. Gentile world power must run its course Dan. 2:34-35. 3. Rom. 11:25-27. The elect of the Gentiles must be brought in. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Nothing is more displeasing to our Lord Jesus Christ than hyprocrisy, dissimulation, stage-playing in religion. Woe be to all such for their religion is vain and their ruin will be terrible. It is wholly owing to the wicked will of sinners that they are not gathered by His love under His protecting wing they "will not come to Him that they might have life." 
Mat 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Destruction of the temple foretold. The course of the present age outlined; its culmination in the great tribulation and followed by the return of Christ in power and glory. Parable of the fig tree and exhortation to watchfulness. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - End of Age, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 21, 27, 35, 37, 44. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The signs of the near return of Jesus are national (v. 6), religious (v. 11), missionary (v. 14), and Jewish (v. 32). (Pig tree a type of Israel.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The course of the present age is to be marked by wars, famines, pestilences, persecutions, false Christs, and religious systems, increasing in intensity as the age nears its end, and culminating in tribulation such as the world has never seen, nor ever shall see again. Jesus Christ shall suddenly, unexpectedly and gloriously appear, coming in the clouds of heaven with His hosts. Blessed are they who cherish the "blessed hope" (Tit. 2:13) and live in hourly expectation of His coming. 
Mat 25:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parables of the wise and foolish virgins. Testing of the servants in the Lord's absence. Future testing of the Gentile nations at the Lord's return. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Christ's return, vv. 6, 19, 31. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13, 29, 31, 32, 34, 40. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 1-13. The strict application is Jewish and refers to the "Revelation" when Christ comes "with His saints" to set up His Kingdom and punish the nations. Virgins are attendants of a bride. "Bridegroom" in some translations is "bride and groom" and "marriage" in v. 10 is "marriage-feast." The virgins are professing Jewish disciples (Rev. 14:4; Psa. 45:14). In the midst of the great Tribulation, the mid-night cry will be raised. As applied to Christians the parable is a warning of the "Rapture" which precedes the "Revelation." The lamp is a type of God's Word and the oil of the Holy Spirit. The two classes distinguish between Possessors of Christianity and Professors of it. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The hour of our Lord's second coming is very uncertain which is good reason why we should live not only in a state of habitual preparation but actual diligence in present service for Him, and engaged in works of charity for men. Those who have so lived will in that day receive the grandest degree in the universe, the "well-done" of Jesus Christ. 
Mat 26:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Authorities plot Christ's death. Jesus annointed by Mary of Bethany. Judas sells Jesus. The last Passover. Lord's supper instituted. Gethsemane experience. Jesus before Caiaphas and Sanhedrin. Peter's denial. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Judas, Peter, James, John, Caiaphas, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jesus' last night, vv. 1, 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 28, 41, 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 26. This verse marks the end of the Mosaic dispensation. The true Paschal Lamb was Christ, and He was now ready for the sacrifice. Yet at the very hour He was offered unbelieving Jews were sacrificing useless blood in the temple. The Lord's supper which takes the place of the O. T. ceremonies is a memorial of Christ as a gift and sacrifice, a parable of the true nature of Christianity Christ becoming a part of us, and a prophecy of His future coming and glory. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Having finished His work as a Prophet, Christ entered upon His work as Priest to make the great sacrifice for the remission of sin. Although wicked hearts laid the plot and put it into execution, they were but fulfilling the Scriptures and unknowingly carrying out the program for which Christ came into the world. The spotless Passover Lamb who ALONE must settle the sin question was prepared for the slaughter, not as a martyr, but as a ransom for all. 
Mat 27:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus delivered to Pilate. Judas' remorse. Barabbas released in Jesus' place. The crucifixion of Christ. The entombment and sealing of the tomb. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Pilate, Judas, Jeremiah, Simon, 3 Marys (v. 56), Elijah, Joseph, two malefactors. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Crucifixion, vv. 1, 35. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22, 54 (b), 35. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Calvary's cross was the main point in the coming of Jesus into the world. His death was the object of His incarnation. He was the "Lamb of God who beareth away the sin of the world." No man took His life from Him (John 10:17-18). He whose blood was more precious than all human blood together (v. 54-b) gave His life (Matt. 28:26). The glory of heaven is not Jesus as a great ethical teacher, but Jesus, the "slain lamb." (Rev. 5:6-12; 7:10; 21:23.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - See Isa. 53:3-6, 9, 10. (It is utter ruin of language to try to draw a human conclusion to the chapter. Rather let the Scriptures themselves interpret it.) 
Mat 28:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Resurrection of Jesus. Jesus in Galilee and the great commission. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, 2 Marys, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Resurrection, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 18, 19, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The resurrection is the centre of all miraculous narratives the sun which keeps them in their orbit. It is the Waterloo of infidelity. If He did not literally rise from the grave, not only is His veracity at stake, but (1 Cor. 15) preaching is vain (v. 14); faith is vain (vv. 14, 17); the witness of the disciples is false (v. 15); we are yet in our sins (v. 17); the dead are perished (v. 18), and our state is most miserable (v 19) BUT "HE IS RISEN." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ is declared to be the Son of God with power, by His resurrection from the dead (v. 18; Rom. 1:4) and the acceptance by the Father of His atoning work on the cross is thereby assured for all who will receive it. Those who would be kept in the consciousness of His presence (v. 20) must attend to that which He has appointed the carrying of the message of salvation to all men. 
Mar 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ministry of John the Baptist. Baptism and temptation of Jesus and His first Galilean ministry. Demons cast out, sickness healed, leprosy cured. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, John the Baptist, Satan, Simon, James, man with demons, Simon's mother-in-law, leper. <br><b>Key Word</b> - First ministry, vv. 1, 14, 21, 32. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 35. There is no conflict between the fact of the deity of Christ and His dependence upon the Father in prayer. His prayer life on earth was the manifestation of His perfect communion with the Father before He came into the world. The fact that Jesus never asked anyone to pray FOR Him, is a further proof of His deity. He was superior to all human intercession. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The deity of Jesus Christ is fully attested by the seal of the Father from heaven, His victory over Satan, His authority to call men, and His power over evil spirits and all manner of diseases. 
Mar 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Healing of the palsied man. Call of Matthew. Parable of the cloth and bottles. Jesus, Lord of the Sabbath. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Paralytic, Matthew, David, Alphaeus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Power of Christ, vv. 10, 28. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10 (a), 17, 27, 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. (Cf. John 10:33.) Jesus was logically either a blasphemer or "God manifest in the flesh." The miracle He performed immediately proved that it was not He who was the blasphemer, but His accusers. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ was sent to a sinful world for the healing and saving of such as will acknowledge their need of salvation and put their trust in Him. He has authority to forgive sin, which strikes at the root of diseases and either cures or alters their property. True faith in Him will overcome all obstacles and bring deliverance. 
Mar 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus heals a withered hand on the Sabbath. Multitudes healed. The twelve chosen. The unpardonable sin. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Holy Spirit, Satan, disciples, man with the withered hand, Mary, Jesus' brothers. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Healing (vv. 2, 10), Calling (v. 13). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 28, 29, 35. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Blaspheming the Holy Ghost is attributing to the devil the work which Christ did by the power of the Holy Ghost. Many of those who reviled Christ on the cross found mercy and Christ Himself prayed  for them, but to blaspheme the Holy Ghost is unpardonable.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who are bound by disease and evil spirits are the special object of Jesus' compassion and may find complete deliverance in Him, do they but stretch out the hand of faith toward Him. Those are obstinate indeed in their unbelief, who set themselves against being convinced of the power of Christ by trying to explain it away, or attributing it to the devil. All such are sinning against their last remedy. 
Mar 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parable of the sower. Parable of the candle. Parable of the mustard seed. Jesus stills the storm. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Satan, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Kingdom parables, vv. 2, 11, 26, 30. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 24, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 38, 39. He who slept the sleep of human exhaustion arises and rebukes the elements. What manner of man is this? It is the Godman truly man, but God manifest in the flesh. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The present age is a time for missions and testimony to the salvation offered in the Word of God. The message will be variously received because of Satanic opposition, but many will prove good soil for the Divine seed and will bring forth fruit by the power of God. 
Mar 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The maniac of Gadara. Woman with issue of blood healed. Daughter of Jairus raised from the dead. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, disciples, demoniac, sick woman, Jairus, his daughter. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Powerful Christ, vv. 19, 29, 42. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 19, 34, 36 (b). <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. Even devils believe in the deity of Christ and tremble before Him. Demons know that by His Word they will ultimately be sent to chains of eternal darkness. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The power of Christ over evil spirits, over incurable physical ailments, and over death itself, demonstrates to a conclusion His deity and puts honor upon the simple faith that comes to Him. Those who by faith are healed of Him, may go in peace and should go to witness of His power and grace. 
Mar 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The twelve sent out to preach. Murder of John the Baptist. The 5000 fed. Jesus walks on the sea. Jesus heals many at Gennesaret. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, disciples, Herod, Herodias, her daughter, John the Baptist, Mary, Joses, Juda, Simon, Elias. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Mighty works, v. 2.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 50 ( b ) . <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 3, 7, 41, 48. Jesus the carpenter was the Controller of the universe. Jesus the son of Mary was Jesus the Son of God. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The divine authority of Christ is ratified by the divine wisdom which He displayed in all His teaching and the divine power which He manifested in imparting power to others for service, in overcoming all laws of nature for the relief of men and in dispelling by His mere Word or touch all manner of diseases. 
Mar 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus rebukes Pharisees. Healing of daughter of Syrophenician woman and a deaf and dumb man. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Pharisees, scribes, disciples, Syrophenician woman, her daughter, deaf man, Isaiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Traditionalism (v. 3), Healing (26, 27). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 37 (b). <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 37. This verse shows what the whole world will say when Christ's mediation is completed and He comes to receive His own. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is worshipping God in vain to rest in the outside of religious exercises when the heart is not right with God. Our first care should be the washing of the heart from wickedness which makes us odious to God, rather than ceremonial washing. Christ never puts any away from Him who fall at His feet in humble faith, and give themselves up to be ruled by Him. 
Mar 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - 4000 fed. Meaning of leaven explained. Blind man outside Bethsaida healed. Peter's confession of faith. The value of a soul. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Peter, disciples, Satan, blind man, Pharisees. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Our Provider, vv. 8, 17, 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 29, 34, 36, 38. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 31. The death of Jesus was clearly not one of defeat, but of victory. He was not a martyr but a divinely appointed sacrifice. "Christ that died" would make no gospel if we could not add "And is risen again." His resurrection proves that He was "the Christ" (v. 29) and that His atoning work is accepted of God and sufficient for all who believe. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The bounty of Christ is inexhaustible and He will supply the needs of the body if with it we glorify Him. It is provoking to Him when we are overwhelmed with present distrust, because we so soon forget what we have seen of His goodness in supplying our needs in days past. 
Mar 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The transfiguration. The powerless disciples and the mighty Christ casting out a demon. The dispute over who should be greatest. Jesus' rebuke of sectarianism. Solemn warning of hell. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Moses, Elijah, Peter, James, John, disciples, a father, his son. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Transfiguration (v. 2), Mighty Christ (v. 19). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 23, 35 (b), 41, 42, 43, 50. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The transfiguration fulfills the promise of Jesus to reveal Himself in His coming kingdom (v. 1) ; teaches us that He was exalted far above Moses (law) and Elijah (prophets) (v. 4); was intended to raise the hopes of the disciples in view of His coming death (v. 30), and warns us against seeking to any other than the Son of God (v. 7). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Since God has from the open heavens owned Jesus Christ as His beloved Son, we should give ourselves to be ruled by His Word, to be yielded to the mighty working of His power in us and through us and to resemble Him in the spirit of humble service to men. 
Mar 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus' law of divorce. The blessing of little children. The rich young ruler. The desire of James and John to be first. Bartimeus receives his sight. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, James, John, Peter, disciples, rich young ruler, Bartimeus, Moses, Pharisees. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Divorce (v. 2), Riches (v. 24), Greatness (v. 44). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 14 (b), 15, 25, 29, 30, 31, 44, 45. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 18. Jesus' object was not to infer that He was not good, for the Scriptures plainly teach His goodness, above all men, but to raise the man's view of His person. The ruler had called Him "Master" (teacher) and looked upon Him merely as a great man, on the same plane with himself (v. 20). Jesus was God, but until His divinity was acknowledged He could not accept the title "good." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Marriage is a divine institution and therefore to be religiously observed. The bond which God has tied is not to be lightly untied. 
Mar 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Official presentation of Jesus as King. The barren fig tree. Purifying of the temple. The prayer of faith. Jesus' authority questioned. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Peter, disciples, John the Baptist, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Triumphal entry, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22, 23, 24, 25. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Lord Jesus, in accordance with the Scriptures, presented Himself as King-Savior at Jerusalem where He displayed His Kingly authority by cleansing the temple. He came seeking fruit of Israel, and gave the sign of their doom knowing His coming rejection by them. 
Mar 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parable of householder demanding fruit from his vineyards. The tribute question. Jesus answers the Sadducees. The great commandments. The widow's mite. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Holy Spirit, Caesar, David, widow, disciples, Sadducees, Herodians, Pharisees, Moses, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Rejected Lord, vv. 6, 10, 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 17, 30, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Jesus knew there could be no obstruction to His exaltation. He is the foundation stone of the Church, will be the smiting stone destroying the Gentile world powers at His coming and will yet be set as heaven's King the headstone of the corner. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Because Christ, God's only Son, made His demands with more authority than any prophet had done, men were enraged against Him and determined by some method to entangle Him and put Him to death. To the last He confounded the wise of the world with His wisdom and set the seal of His favor upon the humble, trusting worshipper. 
Mar 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The course of the present age its culmination in the great tribulation and the Second coming of Christ. Parable of the fig tree. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Daniel, Peter, James, John, Andrew. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Signs of the times, vv. 4, 29. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13, 26, 27, 31, 33, 35, 36. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 28-30. The fig tree is a type of Israel. When Israel again starts to bud as a nation, after hundreds of years in dispersion, we may be sure Christ's coming is near. The word "generation" in v. 30 is literally "race." The nation of Israel has a promise here that it will be preserved until these things are fulfilled. Israel is even now budding His coming is therefore "even at the doors." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The end of the age will be marked by religious apostasy (v. 6), wars and rumors of wars (v. 7), upheavals among kingdoms (v. 8), earthquakes, famines, and trouble (v. 8), the publishing of the gospel in all nations (v. 10), disregard of law (v. 12), and manifestations of hatred toward the preachers of the gospel (v. 13). The age will culminate in a time of trouble such as the world has never known (v. 19), and will end in the glorious appearing of the Christ in the clouds (v. 26). Let it be our care that whenever He will come He may find us at our duty, ready to meet Him. 
Mar 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The plot against Jesus. Jesus annointed by Mary. The last Passover. The Lord's supper instituted. The Gethsemane experience. Peter's denial. Jesus delivered to the authorities. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Mary, Judas, Peter, James, John, disciples, Caiaphas, Chief Priest, maid. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jesus' last night.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 24, 36, 38. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 32-35. What "hour" and "cup" was He seeking to be delivered from? Does He pray for deliverance from the cross the very purpose for which He had come into the world? (John 12:27.) Heb. 5:7 states that His prayer was heard and answered. Luke 22:44. Mark 14:34 shows that Satan was attempting to kill Him before He could accomplish His purpose and Luke 22:43 gives the answer. He was saved from death in Gethsemane. When the hour of the cross comes, He wants no angels or defenders and rebukes Peter for trying to defeat God's plan. Matt. 26:52, 53, 56. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Our Lord Jesus, betrayed into the hands of the violent by His own familiar friend and led away by wicked hands to His death, consecrated Himself to that purpose, for which He came into the world the redemption of mankind by the blood of the cross. A great part of the load of sorrow He bore was that occasioned by His betrayal and denial by those close to Him. 
Mar 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus before Pilate. Barabbas set free instead of Christ.  The  crucifixion.  <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Pilate, Simon, Barabbas, Centurion, Joseph, 2 thieves,Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Joses.  <br><b>Key Word</b> - Crucifixion, v. 24. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 38. Why was the veil rent from the top down? It  was rent from heaven, not earth. Christ having made atonement and glorified God, the way into the holy of holies was now made manifest. Heb. 9:8, 24; 10:19-22.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - 1 Pet. 2:24; Isa. 53:5, 9, 10. (Only God's own Word can form the conclusion of this scene.) 
Mar 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Resurrection and ascension of Jesus. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Peter, disciples, Mary the mother of James and Joses, young man (an angel). <br><b>Key Word</b> - Resurrection, v. 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 15, 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. "And Peter." Peter denied Jesus just before He died. Jesus owned Peter just after His resurrection. Peter's grasp of Christ relaxed. Christ's grasp of Peter was still tight. Peter lost consciousness of Jesus' love but that did not change Jesus. "Nothing shall be able to separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus who was crucified in weakness, lives in power and appears in the midst of the praises of the heavenly host as the "Lamb that was slain" (Rev. 5:6). Let the message be declared to all persons in every land that they might be saved from the guilt and power of sin and prepared to meet Him at His coming. 
Luk 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Birth of John the Baptist foretold. Virgin birth of Jesus foretold. Mary's visit to Elizabeth. Mary's praise because of Jehovah's favor. Birth of John the Baptist. <br><b>Characters</b> - Holy Spirit, Luke, Theophilus, Herod, Zeeharias, Elizabeth, Gabriel, Elias, Joseph, Mary, Abraham, John. <br><b>Key Word</b> - John and Jesus, vv. 31, 60. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 31, 32, 35, 37, 78, 79. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 31-32. The name "Jesus" (Savior) links Him to humanity and suggests His career as Prophet. He is conspicuous as "Jesus" up to His resurrection. "Christ" (annointed One) links Him to Prophecy which He came to fulfill and suggests His work as Priest atoning for sin. "Lord" (the Jehovah name applied to Him) links Him with Deity and suggests His Kingship. He is coming again to rule. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - John, the forerunner of Jesus, came to earth by divine appointment and arrangement. Jesus, the Christ was born of a virgin, conceived of the Holy Ghost, and was therefore the Son of God to whom was promised the throne of His father, David. 
Luk 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Birth of Jesus. His adoration by the shepherds. Adoration and prophecy of Simon and Anna. Return to Nazareth. Jesus and His parents at the Passover. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Caesar, Augustus, Cyrenius, Joseph, Mary, Moses, Simeon, Anna. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Glad Tidings, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 49. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 52. In the perfections of His divine nature there could be no increase. But as Son of Man, in His human nature, His body increased and He grew in all the endowments of a human soul. Christ accommodated Himself as Son of God, to His state of humiliation in human flesh. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus the Christ, in the fullness of time was brought into the world according to divine counsels. Although born amid the meanest circumstances, His humiliation was attended by discoveries of His glory and His coming was announced as glad tidings to all people. From His childhood days He showed forth some of the rays of His glory in the divine wisdom which He manifested. 
Luk 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ministry of John the Baptist. Baptism of Jesus. Genealogy of <br><b>Characters</b> - Holy Spirit, God, John Baptist, Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate, Herod, Philip, Annas, Caiaphas, Zacharias, Abraham. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Baptism, vv. 16, 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 23. Matthew gives Joseph's genealogy Luke gives Mary's. Luke does not say Heli "begat" Joseph. Joseph was his son-inlaw. If Jesus was the son of Joseph, as some claim, He is forever barred from the throne, being a descendant of Coniah who was cursed, that none of his line might have the throne. Jesus was accordingly conceived by the Holy Ghost in Mary, Mary's father being a descendant of David through another line. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Way must be made for the reception of Christ by the removing of all obstructions that stand in the way of Him and of His grace. The seal of His divine authority has been given from the opened heavens; let us therefore prepare to bid His salvation welcome.  
Luk 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Temptation of Jesus. Jesus in the synagogue at Nazareth. Casting of demons out of man at Capernaum. Healing of Peter's wife's mother and others. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Holy Spirit, Satan, Joseph, Elias, Eliseus, Naaman. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Temptation, v. 2. Fame, vv. 14, 32, 36, 37, 40. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 8, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 17-19. It is interesting to notice that Jesus stopped His quotation in the middle of a passage from Isaiah. He stopped with "the acceptable year of the Lord" which is His first advent, but He knew His coming rejection. "The day of vengeance of our God" has to do with His second advent, and He therefore omitted it at the time. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Our Savior was victorious over Satan by the power of the Holy Ghost and the use of the divine Word as His sword and those are well armed who are thus equipped. The words of Christ's mouth were attended with a power which pricked the consciences of men, dispersed evil spirits and drove away disease. 
Luk 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Miraculous draught of fishes. Healing of a leper and a paralytic. Call of Matthew. The scribes and Pharisees answered. Parables of the garment and bottles. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Simon, James, John, leper, Moses, Pharisees, scribes, Levi, John the Baptist. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Faith in Christ, vv. 5, 12, 20, 28. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 24 (a), 32. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 21. The doctrine that Jesus Christ has power to forgive sin has been fully attested, proving that He is God. He appears to be so by what He does in this chapter alone, and human experience through, the centuries witnesses to His deity. Those who charge Him with blasphemy are themselves proven to be blasphemers. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ has divine power to command the very fishes of the sea; to drive out incurable disease by His Word; to separate sinners from the penalty of their sins, and authority to call whom He will. Those will speed well indeed who will take Him at His word and trust to His ability and efficiency whatever their case. 
Luk 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus and the Sabbath. Healing of a withered hand. Choosing of the twelve. Sermon on the Mount. Parable of the house built on a rock. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, disciples, Pharisees, David, man with withered hand. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lord of Sabbath, v. 5. Sermon on Mount, vv. 12, 20. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 31, 35, 37, 38, 41, 45, 46. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Jesus as a human being in perfect subjection to the Father walked in constant communion with Him through prayer. In those days when His enemies were filled with madness against Him, He gave much time to prayer. If He, the Son of God, needed to pray, how much more business should we have at the throne of grace? <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Works of necessity are allowable on the Sabbath and above all it is to be spent in the service of and to the honor of Him who is Lord of the Sabbath, whose good works we are to perform. 
Luk 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Centurion's servant healed. Widow's son raised. Questions from John the Baptist in prison and Jesus' testimony. Jesus annointed in the Pharisee's house. Parable of the creditor and two debtors. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, centurion's servant, centurion, man who was raised, his mother, John the Baptist, Pharisees, sinful woman, Simon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Healer and For giver, vv. 10, 48. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 23, 47, 50. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 28. This is usually taken to mean that the "least" of those who preach the Gospel of the risen Lord, being employed under a more excellent dispensation, are in a more honorable office than John the Baptist, who merely announced His birth and ministry. The meanest of those who follow the Lamb, excel the greatest of those, in position, who proclaim His advent. Those living under the Gospel dispensation have therefore a greater responsibility. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - He who had such a commanding empire in the kingdom of nature as that He could command away diseases and raise the dead, is certainly none other than the Messiah, long announced by the prophets and empowered for the forgiveness of sins. 
Luk 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus preaching and healing in Galilee. Parable of the sower, the lighted candle. Stilling of the waves. Demons cast out of man of Gadara. Healing of a woman. Raising of Jairus' daughter. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Susanna, Jesus' mother and brothers, disciples, the Gadarene, Jairus, woman with issue of blood, Peter, servant of Jairus, James, John, daughter of Jairus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Preaching and showing, v. 1. (See v. 4, preaching; vv. 25, 35, 48, 55, shewing.) <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 17, 18, 21, 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 28. Demon-possessed men never have expectation to receive benefit from Jesus Christ, nor inclination to do Him service, a fact which alone proves His deity. Demons know Him to be the Son of God who is ultimately to execute vengeance. They express only dread of Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is the comfort of God's people that all power is given unto Jesus Christ, their Saviour. He has under His check and control, the elements of the universe, the prince of the power of the air with all his most malignant demons, all human diseases, even death itself, and exercises these powers as will best glorify God. He is rich in fact who is rich in faith in Christ, having received the good seed of His promises into their hearts. 
Luk 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The twelve sent forth to preach and their return. 5000 fed. Peter's confession of Christ. The transfiguration. The powerless disciples and the demon ridden boy. Jesus' rebuke of sectarianism. Tests of discipleship. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, God, disciples, Herod, John the Baptist, Peter, Elijah, John, James, Moses, man and his demon ridden son. <br><b>Key Word</b> - The mighty Christ, v. 43. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 23, 25, 26, 35. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 22. 44. When men had a fond conceit of a temporal kingdom in which Christ, the miracle worker, should reign to supply all their needs, He would have one truth "sink down into their ears" the absolute necessity of His atonement. All His miracles and the interest He had gotten by them, could not prevent His sacrifice on the cross. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ is God's annointed, owned to be so from the opened heavens and by the lives of witnesses and shown to be so in His superiority over all forces; His ability to empower others for supernatural work; His power to supply both temporal and spiritual needs and His authority over malignant spirits. Wise are they who give up all to cleave to Him, for though they lose their lives for His sake, they shall gain life to their unspeakable advantage. 
Luk 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The 70 sent out. Jesus denounces judgment on cities. Parable of the good Samaritan. Martha and Mary entertain Jesus. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, 70 witnesses, Satan, lawyer, Martha, Mary. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Service, vv. 1, 30, 38. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 20, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 21. Jesus rejoiced (only time recorded) to perfect strength out of weakness for His own glory. He is pleased to reveal His counsels in those whose extraction and education have nothing in them promising until He, by the Holy Spirit, elevates their faculties and furnishes them with this knowledge. The believer need not therefore be disturbed if some of the "wise and prudent" of the world would crucify Him afresh. Vital experience of Christ in the soul over-balances all human reasonings about Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Whom Christ sends may be sure He will go along with them and give them success. His servants should apply themselves to their work under a deep concern for precious souls, looking upon them with His compassion, and as riches which ought to be secured for Him. True service for Him comes out of communion with Him, and that service is worthless to Him which is done with motives of selfish pride. 
Luk 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus' doctrine of prayer. Jesus charged with casting out demons by Beelzebub, and His answer. Woes denounced upon the Pharisees and lawyers. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, disciples, Satan, Jonah, Solomon, Queen of the South, Pharisees, lawyers, scribes, Abel, Zacharias. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prayer, v. 1. Evil generation, v. 29 (14,54). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3, 4, 9, 13, 23, 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 29. The sign from God for the confirmation of our faith is the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is the greatest and most convincing proof that He was sent from God. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - One great design of Christianity is to enforce upon us the duty of prayer, instruct us in it and encourage us to expect advantage by it. Prayer changes things. Our prayers are God's opportunities to do for us what He otherwise could not do. Let us therefore lay hold of God's willingness with confidence and cling to Him with persistency. Obstinate infidelity will never be at loss for something to say in its own excuse, though ever so absurd. They will yet be compelled to face Him in judgment to answer for all their absurdities and will see the emptiness of all external ceremonies. 
Luk 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus warns of leaven of the Pharisees. Parable of the rich fool. Parable of the second coming. Parable of the steward and his servants. Christ, the divider of men. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, disciples, Pharisees, rich man, Peter. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jesus our security, vv. 7, 8, 11, 28, 31, 37. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 22, 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 37, 40, 48. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 40. Jesus is certainly coming back to earth in power and great glory and His people are now to live in a state of expectation, doing everything with that hope and to that end. The theology of v. 45 is characterized as the theology of unfaithful stewards who will be caught unawares to their shame. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who make not religion a mere cloak, but have a saving faith in Christ, can set at defiance all the opposing forces of the world, knowing that having given Him first place in their lives, they are safe in Him. They need not take anxious thought for the things of this life nor dread even the killing of the body, which can only send them to their rest and eternal joy with Christ the sooner. Let them therefore sit loose to the world, living in hourly hope of His glorious return. 
Luk 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parable of barren fig tree. Woman loosed from her infirmity. Parable of mustard seed and leaven. Jesus teaching on way to Jerusalem. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Galileans, Pilate, infirm woman, ruler of synagogue, Abraham, Satan, Isaac, Jacob, Pharisees, Herod. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Hypocrites rejected, vv. 15, 25, 30, 35. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 24, 34. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 6-9. The fig tree symbolizes Israel in Christ's time (Psa. 80:8-16). Three years and more Jesus sought fruit of this tree and found none. Having produced all His credentials as Messiah, He made His triumphal entry with multitudes shouting "Hosanna," but He knew they would shortly shout "crucify." The next day He saw a fig tree and finding nothing but leaves, He cursed it. (Mark 11:12-14.) See v. 34. This is Israel's condition "until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Genuine repentance and faith toward Christ is the only avenue of escape from perishing. Nothing can be expected concerning barren and hypocritical lives except that they should be cut down and cast away. Not all who say "Lord, Lord" will find entrance to His kingdom, and to be bidden by Him that day to "depart" means hell. Those who would be saved must enter in at the strait gate, having undergone a change of heart. 
Luk 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus heals on the Sabbath. Parable of the ambitious guest. Parable of the great supper. Parable of the tower, of the king going to war, and of the savorless salt. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Pharisees, lawyers, man with dropsy. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Great supper, v. 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 26, 27, 33. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - In the two parables of Luke 14:16-24 and Matt. 22:1-14 we see the historical development of the plan of salvation. (1) Prophetic announcement represented by the first invitation. (2) Second epoch, complete preparation followed by acts of violence. (3) Extension of the invitation to the hitherto uninvited guests, the Gentiles. The key note is Matt. 22:14. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Pride and hypocrisy will get shame and will at last have a fall, for the Master of the feast will marshall His guests and will not see the more honorable miss their due. 
Luk 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parables of the lost sheep, lost coin and lost son. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Pharisees, scribes. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lost and found, vv. 4, 8, 32. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 18. If one has been in the Father's house as a son, he, like the prodigal is still a son and will be constantly constrained by the Holy Spirit and the intercessory work of Christ to "arise and go to the Father." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God has a particular care over backsliding sinners (Isr. in this case) and follows them with the calls of His Word and the strivings of the Holy Spirit until at length they are wrought upon to return. Their repentance and conversion are a matter of joy and rejoicing among the angels of heaven. 
Luk 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parable of the unjust steward. Jesus answers Pharisees. Rich man -and Lazarus in the spirit world. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, disciples, John the Baptist, rich man, Lazarus, Abraham, five brothers of rich man, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Wisdom, v. 8; opportunity lost, v. 25. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 13, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 23. "Hell" is lit, "hades," the prison place of departed unsaved spirits until the time of the Great White Throne judgment, when these spirits shall be resurrected for judgment and sent into the final hell forever. This is not a parable, for Jesus never names the characters in parables, with definite statements of things that took place. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Worldlings are often more consistent with themselves and more enthusiastically pursue their ends than Christians. Though they aim low  they aim better, improving their opportunities and doing that first which is most needed. Let us he thus wise in spiritual affairs. Prosperity is not a mark of being a favorite of heaven, nor poverty  a mark of God's rejection of a man. Salvation is appropriated by those only who accept the evidence of God's Word during their lifetime, and, having died outside of Christ, there is no ray of hope eternally.   
Luk 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Instruction in forgiveness. Parable of service. Ten lepers healed. Second coming of Jesus foretold. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, disciples, ten lepers, Pharisees, Noah, Lot, Lot's wife. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Duty, v. 10; thankfulness, v. 16; Second Coming, v. 24. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 6, 24, 26, 34, 36. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 21. Jesus did not teach these wicked men that the "kingdom of the heavens was "within" them, but "among" them. It was then in their midst in the person of the Savior and His disciples. He has a kingdom which is yet to come with outward show (v. 24) and with such suddenness that men will not be able to point here and there and say "the kingdom is coming." This is exactly what men are now trying to do, thinking the earthly kingdom can be set up without the King present. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's relation to the believer is not one of contract but of ownership, and since we never can merit His favors, we should ever let Him have the praise of His comforts, while we seek to manifest His spirit toward our fellowmen. 
Luk 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parable of the unjust judge. Parable of Pharisee and publican. Little children blessed. Rich young ruler. Death and resurrection foretold. Blind man healed near Jericho. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Pharisee, publican, Peter, disciples, blind man. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prayer, vv. 1, 10; discipleship, vv. 22, 29, 43. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 7, 14, 17, 27, 29, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 31-34. Christ ever speaks of His sufferings as necessary to the fulfillment of Scripture. (1 Pet. 1:11.) His death on Calvary was absolutely essential and would have taken place in any case. He came to give His life a ransom, and therefore did not die as a martyr. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Trouble and perplexity should drive us to prayer, for it is persistent and believing prayer that drives trouble and perplexity away. There is, however, no way of approach to God on the ground of our own merits, but only on the ground of God's mercy as shown at the bloodsprinkled mercy seat ("mercy" is lit. "propitiation." The publican said, "be toward me as thou art when thou lookest upon the atoning blood"). True discipleship is conditioned upon receiving the Lord Jesus Christ with the simplicity and humility of a child, being willing to follow Him and submit to His discipline whatever it may cost us in the things of this world, being confident that whatever we have left behind for His sake will be abundantly made up to us in better things, both here and hereafter. 
Luk 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Conversion of Zaccheus. Parable of the pounds. Triumphal entry. Jesus weeps over Jerusalem. Purification of the temple. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Zacchaeus, Abraham, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Coming King, vv. 12, 38. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 26. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 38. The great honor paid to Christ by multitudes makes the ignominy of His death to appear the greater. He could have influenced all men as easily as those to whom the ass and colt belonged, but the Great Ambassador of heaven knew He was entering Jerusalem to be rejected and crucified according to the divine purpose. The great song of rejoicing will yet be taken up by innumerable multitudes when He returns to receive the Church and set up His Kingdom. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Lord Jesus came from heaven to make possible the bringing of those that are lost to God. Having made this provision, He has gone into a far country to receive for Himself a Kingdom and return in great power. He has endued His followers in the world with advantages and capacities of serving the interests of His church until He returns to receive it, when all shall render account to Him and receive their reward accordingly. 
Luk 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus' authority questioned. Parable of the vineyard. Question of the tribute money. Answer to Sadducees about resurrection. Jesus questions Scribes. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, priests, Scribes, John the Baptist, Caesar, Sadducees, Moses, Abraham. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Christ's authority, vv. 2, 13, 44. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 25, 38. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 44. Christ as God was David's Lord, but Christ as man was David's son. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who question Christ's authority, if they would but catechize themselves in the most evident principles of religion, will have their folly made manifest, for the evidence of His authority is complete and convincing. Those who are resolved not to recognize His authority, disowning Him as Lord of the Vineyard, will find themselves eventually thrown out of their lease, and stripped of all their title, for He will yet become the headstone of the corner. 
Luk 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The widow's mite. Discourse on the course of the age and return of the Lord. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, widow, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Course of age, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9, 18, 25, 26, 27, 33. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 20-24. Two sieges of Jerusalem are in view in this chapter. These verses refer to the siege of Titus, A. D. 70, when v. 24 was fulfilled. Christ did not come then. Jerusalem has been trodden down throughout the present dispensation and will ever be disputed about until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled and He comes who is rightful King. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - As the time draws near when the Kingdom of God shall be fully established upon the earth, and the King shall return in glory, the days will be characterized by increasing apostasy, disturbances in the earth and in the heavens, and intense hatred of those who proclaim the Gospel. The age will culminate in a period of terrible fear upon man, and then shall Christ appear. 
Luk 22:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Judas covenants to betray Jesus. Last passover. Lord's supper instituted. Peter's denial predicted. Jesus' arrest. Peter's denial. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, priests, scribes, disciples, Judas, Peter, Satan, captains, maid. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Jesus' last night, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 19, 20, 42. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 19-20. The Lord's supper itself is an evidence of Christ's <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ, in fulfillment of the Scriptures, was betrayed into the hands of wicked men by His own familiar friend, and as the spotless Lamb of God was led away to the slaughter, for the purpose to which He had consecrated Himself, the shedding of His blood for the putting away of sin. He faced the issue alone, victorious over all Satanic attempts to turn Him from the divine purpose, and forsaken by His own, went forth  to be slain.   
Luk 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus before Pilate and Herod. Barabbas released and Jesus condemned. The cricifixion and entombment. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Pilate, Caesar, Herod, Barabbas, Simon, two thieves, Joseph. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Crucifixion. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 14, 33, 38, 45, 46. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 4, 14, 43. The holiness of Jesus is attested by adverse witnesses. Centurion, v. 47. Thief, v. 41. Pilate, vv. 4, 14. Pilate's wife, Matt. 27:19. Judas, Matt. 27:3-4. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - (Only the divine Word can conclude this scene.) See Isa. 53:3-6, 10; 1 Cor. 15:3-4. 
Luk 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Resurrection of Christ. Ministry of the risen Christ. His commission to evangelization. The ascension. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, angels, Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary mother of James, Peter, disciples, Cleopas. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Resurrection. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 6, 25, 39, 44, 46, 49. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 49. Those who are to proclaim this supernatural Gospel need to be endued with power from on high. The church of Christ could never have been set up by any human power, neither can its message prosper without the same baptism of the Spirit. As the disciples tarried for Pentecost, so let none venture today upon their embassy until they have received power from on high. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus who suffered all things in fulfillment of the divine warrant, also came forth from the domain of death in fulfillment of the same Scriptures, thereby being shown to be the Son of God with power, whose authority may never be questioned. Those who have come to know the power of His death and resurrection must go and tell a guilty world that an act of indemnity has passed the royal assent which all that believe shall have the benefit of. 
Joh 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Deity of Christ. Ministry of John the Baptist. Jesus announced as the Lamb of God, and the first converts to Him. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, John the Baptist, Moses, Elias, Isaiah, Pharisees, Andrew, Simon, Philip, Nathaniel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - The Word, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 13, 14, 17, 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. To teach "believing on Christ" for salvation proves His deity. If He was a created or finite being, to teach eternal salvation by believing on Him is blasphemy. Only God can bring eternal life by belief in Himself. To experience new life by believing proves that Jesus was God manifest in the flesh. (See Jer. 17:5.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Son of God became the Son of Man that the sons of men through Him might become the sons of God. The next thing to finding Him as the Lamb of God is to find another and introduce that one to Him. 
Joh 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The marriage at Cana and the first miracle of Jesus. The passover and the purification of the temple.  Characters: Jesus, mother, disciples.  Conclusion: Those who expect the favors of Christ must with an implicit obedience observe His orders. Those who follow Him shall fare with Him. The way of duty is the way to mercy.  <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, mother, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Obedience, vv. 5, 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 19. The ability of Christ to drive this crowd from their posts without opposition was in itself proof of His authority, but if that does not convince, the great sign, His resurrection, will settle the question.  His resurrection is the Waterloo of infidelity.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who expect the favors of Christ must with an implicit obedience observe His orders. Those who follow Him shall fare with Him. The way of duty is the way to mercy.  
Joh 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Nicodemus and the new birth. The last testimony of John the Baptist. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Nicodemus, John the Baptist, Moses, John's disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - New birth, v. 3.   <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19, 36. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. The bitten Israelite was healed by simply looking to the brazen serpent, not by looking at his wound, although he must of course be conscious of his condition. One look healed the bite. So one look of faith to Jesus saves. It is not the way we look, but the object we look at that heals. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Since the natural man, however gifted, moral, or refined, is absolutely blind to spiritual truth and impotent to enter the kingdom, a new birth through Christ as the channel and the Holy Spirit as the power is an absolute necessity. Heaven is a prepared place for a prepared people. The only gateway to it is Jesus. 
Joh 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus and the Samaritan woman. The indwelling Spirit. The nobleman's son healed. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Holy Spirit, John the Baptist, Pharisees, Jacob, Joseph, woman of Samaria, her husband, nobleman, his son. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Living water, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 14, 23, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 29. The divine knowledge of Jesus proves His omniscience. Jesus knows the thoughts, words and actions of all the children of men, and by the power of His Words is still revealing to men the secret sins of their hearts.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ is the gift of God, the richest token of God's love, the source and fountain of those living waters, the graces of the Holy Spirit which satisfy the thirsting soul and make a life overflowing with goodness. Those who come face to face with their own helplessness and sin and give their hearts to Him will be the recipients of these living waters. 
Joh 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Healing of the man at the pool of Bethesda. Jesus answers the Jews. The four-fold witness to Jesus. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, infirm man, John the Baptist, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Healing, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 23, 24, 28, 29, 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 18. Jesus was killed because of His claims to deity. If He was not what He claimed to be (v. 23), He was a blasphemer, but this is out of the question, since He was raised from the dead. Therefore, those who deny His deity take their stand with His murderers. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ, the omnipotent Son of God, delights to help the helpless, and manifests His mercy to those who are willing to be helped. He who thus overrules the powers of nature on behalf of trusting souls can be no other than the Son of God, in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells. 
Joh 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Feeding the 5000. Walking on the sea. Discourse on the Bread of Life. Peter's confession of faith. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, disciples, boy, Moses, Joseph. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Bread, vv. 5, 33. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 27, 29, 35, 37, 39, 40, 44, 51, 63. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 27. Jesus is sealed by God the Father as the Savior of *h world. By His anointing 1:32-34. By the voice from heaven 12: 28-30. By His protection 7:28-30. By the character of His teaching 7:16-17. By the resurrection 20:19. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ, the true Bread, is that to the soul which bread is to the body, nourishing and supporting the spiritual life. Our bodies could live better without food than our souls without Christ. Those who have received this Bread are to be the distributors of it to other hungry souls. 
Joh 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus urged to go to the feast. His final departure from GalilepTPSUS at the feast of tabernacles. Prophecy concerning the Holy Spirit.<br><b>Characters</b> - God. Jesus, Holy Spirit, disciples, brothers of Jesus, Moses. Pharisees, David. Nicodemus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Water, vv. 37, 38. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 37, 38, 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. Either Jesus was merely "a good man," a "deceiver" or what He claimed the divine Son of God. If He is not what He claimed, He cannot be a good man. Those who deny His deity therefore  put Him on a level with the devil (Rev. 20:10).   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is the comfort of those who embrace Christ's doctrine that it is a divine doctrine, proven so by the blessed experience of what He promises. He is the source of the refreshing fountain of the Holy Spirit, which comes to replenish the soul that thirsts for Him, and to supply a fullness of life that overflows in blessing to other lives. 
Joh 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The woman taken in adultery. Discourse after the feast on Jesus as Light of the world. Satan, the original liar and murderer, and the Satanic brotherhood. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, adulterous woman, Moses, Pharisees, scribes, Abraham, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Light of the world, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 12, 32, 36, 42, 44, 47. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 18. Jesus Christ was witnessed to by the Father. He was taught by the Father v. 28. Attended by the Father v. 38. Sent by the Father v. 42. Honored by the Father v. 54. Known by the Father v. 55. The power of Christ over the lives of men throughout the centuries demonstrates to a conclusion that He is the one sealed by the Father as the Light of the world. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus was the Light of the world, the image of the invisible God. Those shall have the light of life who follow Him, being guided away from destroying error and damning sin, and having that enjoyment of God which will be to them the light of spiritual life in this world and life everlasting in the world to come. All who will have God for their Father must discover Him through the Light of the world. 
Joh 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Healing of the man born blind. The fault finding of unbelievers. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, blind man, disciples, Pharisees, neighbors, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Light, vv. 7, 37. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 39. Christ came into the world designedly to give sight to those that were spiritually blind, by His Word and Spirit to turn many from darkness to light. He came also that those who had a high conceit of their own wisdom, in contradiction to the divine revelation, might be sealed up in their infidelity. The Gospel is a savor of life unto life, or of death unto death. Blindness has happened to Israel. The Gentiles have seen a great light. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Lord Jesus Christ came into the world, not only to give light, but sight to those who could not behold light. The sight that He gives to trusting souls proves Him to be the One sent of God to be the true light of the world. Experience of His saving power is a safer teaching than reason, therefore let those whose eyes have been opened be bold to witness to a world that would explain away His power. 
Joh 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Discourse on the Good Shepherd. Jesus' deity asserted. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Shepherd, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 11, 14, 27, 28, 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 11. Jesus as our "Good Shepherd" died to save us. As our "Great Shepherd" He lives to guide us. Heb. 13:20. As the "Chief Shepherd" He is coming back to glorify us. 1 Peter 5:3.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God, our great owner, the sheep of whose pasture we are by creation, has constituted His Son, Jesus Christ, to be our Shepherd. He has all that care of His people that a good shepherd has of his flock. In His care, the true believer is eternally secure, for the hand that was wounded and the hand of our Creator close in omnipotent, double grasp upon him. 
Joh 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Raising of Lazarus. Enmity of the Pharisees against Jesus. Characters: Jesus, Lazarus, Mary, Martha, disciples, Pharisees, Thomas, <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Lazarus, Mary, Martha, disciples, Pharisees, Thomas, <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lazarus raised, vv. 23, 44. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 25, 26, 40. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 5-6. Jesus' delays in answer to prayer are not necessarily denials. He may delay because He loves us, and always for His own glory. Let us not, therefore, complain because we cannot understand His dealings, but trust in Him, knowing we shall see the glory of God. (v. 40.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ is the resurrection and the life the fountain of life and the head and author of the resurrection. Whoever, during life, lives by faith in Him, is born again to a heavenly life, and though the body die, yet shall it live again at His word.  
Joh 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The supper at Bethany. The triumphal entry. Jesus' answer to Greeks. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Lazarus, Mary, Martha, disciples, Judas, Philip, Andrew, Isaiah, Pharisees. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Rejection, vv. 4, 11, 19, 38, 40, 48. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 25, 26, 32, 35, 46, 48. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 32. The cross of Jesus is the mightiest magnet in the universe. It is Christ that draws and Christ crucified. The increase of the church was after His death. While He lived we read of thousands miraculously fed, but after His death we read of thousands added to the church through a single sermon. Is there a greater proof of His divine authority today? <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The most plentiful and powerful means of conviction will not of themselves work faith in the depraved and prejudiced hearts of men. Many hear, but few heed. Their final judgment is reserved to the last day, and the Word of Christ will judge them then and make them answer for all the contempts they have put upon Him. 
Joh 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Last Passover. Jesus washes disciples' feet. Betrayal foretold, also Peter's denial. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, God, Judas, disciples, Peter, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Humility, vv. 5, 14, 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1 (b), 16, 34, 35. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 3, 4, 5, 12, 16. Jesus "arose" from His place in glory, laid aside the garments of divine majesty. (Phil. 2:6-7.) Took the form of a "servant" (Phil. 2:7). Provides "cleansing" (John 15:3). Applies the cleansing water (Eph. 5:26). "Took His garments" again (John 17:5), and is seated. (Heb. 10:12.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - What was consistent with the dignity of the Lord Jesus Christ is much more consistent with ours, His servants. To sink is the way to rise. To serve in humility is the way to rule. Let us take heed lest Christ's condescensions to us and advancement of us, through our corrupt nature, cause us to think high thoughts of ourselves, or low thoughts of Him. 
Joh 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus foretells His second coming and promises the Holy Spirit to believers. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Thomas, disciples, Philip, Judas. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Peace, vv. 1, 27. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3/6, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 26, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 16. The word "Comforter" means "one called alongside to help." The Holy Spirit is the indwelling representative of Christ on the earth. It is He who guides us into the truth concerning Christ, forms Christ's purposes in our hearts, and even prays through us. (Rom. 8:26.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus is the way let us follow Him. Jesus is the truth let us build with confidence upon the precious truths of His comforting promises. Jesus is the life let us learn to abide in Him, the source of spiritual life, until He comes back to receive us to the prepared mansions above. 
Joh 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus' discourse on the vine and the branches. The believer and the world.<br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Abiding, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 26. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Christ proved His love to the world by laying down His life for it (1 John 3:16) in redemption work. His love to us should ever be the standard of measure of our love to others in service for Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus is the true vine, in which the life of believers, as abiding branches, is hid. Abiding in Him, the believer is able to walk in purity of life, with Christ sharing in all the interests of his life, taking all burdens to Him, and drawing all wisdom and strength from Him. It is only the abiding life that bears fruit to the glory of the Father. 
Joh 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Warning of persecutions. The promise of the Spirit and His three-fold work. Jesus talks of His death, resurrection and second coming. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Holy Spirit, God, disciples. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Holy Spirit, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 22, 23, 27, 33. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The sending of the Holy Spirit was the fruit of Christ's purchase on the cross and an answer to His intercession within the veil a proof of the acceptance of His finished work with the Father. He is the companion of the true believer in every place and at all times, whereas Christ's corporal presence could be in but one place at a time. As to unbelievers, the Holy Spirit proves sin upon them because of their rejection of Christ, and warns of judgment. To the believer, He is the constant helper and the revealer of the things of Christ. 
Joh 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jesus' prayer of intercession. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, disciples, Judas. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Intercession, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 11, 17, 18, 21, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - This prayer, to which there is no "Amen" attached, is believed to be typical of that perfect intercession of our High Priest in heaven. (Heb. 7:25.) One who has the support of this prayer, as a true child of God, cannot be lost. Peter, when he fell, was kept by the intercession of Jesus. Judas (v. 12), when he fell, fell eternally, not being a true believer (John 6:70-71). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - If God be our Father, we have an intercessor to appear for us continually to guarantee our safe delivery to the haven above and our keeping along the way. He prays not for the world but for those who are His, that they might be preserved in their salvation, that they might have His joy, that they might be fortified against the evils of the world, that they might be purified through His Word, that they might manifest oneness with Him, that they might be edified in Him and at last behold His glory.

In Eden's garden, the first Adam sinned. In Gethsemane's garden, the second Adam suffered and prayed. In Eden all was delightful and bright here all was painful and dark. In Eden there was disobedience and the first Adam hid. Here there was perfect obedience, and the second Adam presented Himself as the spotless Lamb of God, ready for sacrifice.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Our Lord Jesus, having put on the armor of prayer, went forth to face the great conflict with Satanic hatred and the sin of the world. Betrayed, misunderstood and denied by those of His own familiar friends, He, the perfect One, was handed over into wicked hands, to face alone the condemnation of a guilty world, that those who should believe upon Him might not be condemned. 
Joh 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Pilate brings Jesus before the multitude. The rejection of the Savior and the crucifixion. His entombment. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Pilate, soldiers, Jesus' mother, His aunt, wife of Cleophas, Mary Magdalene, Joseph,Nicodemus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Crucifixion, v. 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4 (b), 17, 18, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The death of Jesus fulfilled every sacrificial ceremony of the Old Testament. He was the "passover lamb." As the blood of the Old Testament sacrifice was sprinkled seven times (Num. 19:1-10), so there  was a seven-fold sprinkling of the blood of Jesus in His crucifixion. 1. Scourged 19:1. 2. Thorns 19:2; 3-4. Each hand pierced. 5-6. Each foot pierced. 7. The spear thrust v. 34.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Only Scripture itself can conclude this scene. Isa. 53 (whole chapter).   
Joh 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Resurrection of Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - Mary Magdalene, Peter, John, two angels, Jesus, disciples, Thomas. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Resurrection, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 21, 29 (b), 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 31. This verse defines the purpose of God's Word the demonstrating of the deity of Jesus Christ and the efficacy of His salvation. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - He who gave His life as a ransom resumed His life again by the mighty power of God, proving the acceptability of His sacrifice as a satisfaction for sin, with the Father, and offering to all who should trust in Him, the peace of God that passes all understanding. 
Joh 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The risen Christ surprises the disciples and directs their fishing. Peter given opportunity to reaffirm His allegiance to Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, disciples, Peter, Thomas, John. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Service (v. 6) and love (v. 15). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 16, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 25. The truth about Jesus Christ could never be exhausted. Jesus never spoke an idle word nor did an idle thing. He wrought probably thousands of miracles of which we have no record. All that is needful for our salvation is written. The ages of eternity will reveal the wonders of the life of the Son of God. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In those disappointments which to us are very grievous, our Master often has designs that are very gracious. They are happy and successful in their work who know how to take hints from Him, for nothing can be lost but much gained by following His orders. 
Act 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Resurrection ministry of Christ. The apostolic commission. Promise of the Lord's second coming. Waiting for the coming of the Spirit. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Spirit, Luke, Theophilus, John the Baptist, disciples, Mary, Peter, David, Judas, Joseph, Matthias. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Tarrying, vv. 4, 8, 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 8, 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 11. This is one of the most definite promises of the second coming in the Scriptures. This "same Jesus" not another (John 14:16), is coming "in like manner" as He went up in the clouds visibly. This could not have been fulfilled in the coming of the Spirit at Pentecost. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Waiting on God for the anointing of the Spirit is the great condition of spiritual blessing and fullness of power. Those whom Jesus Christ employs as His witnesses He will qualify for it by a better spirit than their own the Holy Spirit, His representative. 
Act 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Holy Spirit's coming on day of Pentecost. The gospel given to the Jews. Peter's great sermon on the resurrected Christ, and the conviction of the people. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, disciples, Peter, Joel, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Holy Ghost, v. 4. Witnessing, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 21, 23, 24, 33, 36, 38, 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 32-34. Three conclusive proofs are here given that Jesus Christ arose from the dead. 1. He was seen by the disciples. 2. The Holy Spirit has come upon men, and this promise was conditioned by Jesus upon His resurrection. 3. The prophecies declared He must not see corruption. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Upon Jesus Christ's return to heaven, He poured forth the Holy Spirit upon His own, proving His arrival there as the crucified Lamb of God, and distinguishing His followers as messengers from heaven. The fullness of the Holy Spirit is necessary to a true understanding of the Scriptures and to the presenting of Jesus the Christ in convicting power to unsaved men. 
Act 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The lame man healed at the temple gate. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Peter, John, lame man, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Pilate, Moses, Samuel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Power of Christ, vv. 8, 12, 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 18, 19, 26. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. They preserved a murderer, a destroyer of life, and thought to destroy the Saviour, the author of life. But God raised Him from the dead, proving that in fighting against Jesus, they were fighting against God. The doctrine of Jesus Christ was thereby confirmed, and the reproach of His sufferings was rolled away. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The hand of compassion, extended by Spirit-filled men, in the name of Jesus Christ, the risen Lord, is fraught with power to lift men heavenward. The cures of Christ are visible to all let men therefore know that He who was crucified was none other than the Prince of Life. 
Act 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The first persecution. Peter's address to the Sanhedrin. Preaching in Jesus' name forbidden. Christians again filled with the Spirit. State of  the Church at Jerusalem.  <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Peter, priests, captain, Sadducees, elders,  scribes, Annas, Alexander, lame man, John, David, Herod, Pilate, Moses.   <br><b>Key Word</b> - Persecution, vv. 3, 29. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 12, 20, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. Those are eternally undone who do not take shelter in the name of Jesus Christ and make it their refuge and strong tower. Only by embracing Him and Him only, receiving His doctrine, is there salvation for any.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The more resolute are Christ's servants to witness of Him, the more spiteful will be the agents of Satan therefore, let Satan's agents  be ever so spiteful, Christ's witnesses must be resolute, for the Holy Spirit may be counted upon to enable them to do their part. Persecution gives wings to the truth.  
Act 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sin and death of Ananias and Sapphira. The second persecution and answer of apostles to their persecutors. Warning of Gamaliel. Apostles beaten. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Ananias, Sapphira, apostles, Satan, Peter, priest, Sadducees, officers, Gamaliel, Theudas. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lying (to Holy Ghost), vv. 3, 9. Persecution, vv. 18, 33, 40. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 29, 31, 32, 39, 42. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 31. God has invested Christ with the highest dignity and entrusted Him with the highest authority. It is He alone who is authorized to give repentance and remission to men. The new heart is His work, the broken spirit a sacrifice of His providing, the putting away of sin His task alone. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Beware of going to greater length in profession than the inner life will stand being ambitious to be counted religious and liberal while secretly cherishing selfish motives-^for this is lending oneself to Satan and lying, not merely to men, but to the Holy Ghost, a great affront to God. 
Act 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The first deacons. Third persecution. Stephen before the council. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, apostles, Stephen, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, Nicolas, priests, Moses, elders, scribes. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Deacons, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who are called to preach the Word of God must not neglect this special ministry for church activities that should be carried on by others. Those engaged in the work of Christ's church regardless of how menial may be their task, must be free from scandal, men that can be trusted, possessed of discretion and filled with the Holy Ghost. 
Act 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Address of Stephen before the council. Stephen martyred. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Stephen, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Pharaoh, Moses, Pharaoh's daughter, Aaron, Solomon, Saul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Testimony, v. 1. Martyrdom, v. 59. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 52, 55, 56. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 56. Col. 3:1 tells us when Jesus ascended, He sat down in heaven. Stephen sees Him standing. He stood to welcome to heaven the first martyr. He will stand again when the hour of the rapture of the Church is at hand. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who are filled with the Holy Ghost and the Word of God cannot but speak boldly against sin, and they will be made fit for anything, either to act for Christ or to suffer for Him. As their afflictions for Christ abound, their consolation in Him may yet more abound. Let us as we witness look constantly to Christ that we may be ever set above the fear of man. 
Act 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Saul persecuting Christians. The first missionaries. The case of Simon, the sorcerer. Philip and the Ethiopian. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Saul, Stephen, Philip, Simon, apostles, Peter, John, angels, Ethiopian, Isaiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Preaching Christ, vv. 4, 5, 12, 25, 35, 40. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 20, 37. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 37. A short but comprehensive confession of faith. The deity of Jesus Christ is the principal doctrine of Christianity, and those who believe it with all their hearts and confess it are to be baptized and only those. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Where Jesus Christ is preached and the gospel is embraced, Satan is forced to quit his hold of men, and those are restored to their right mind who, while they were blinded by Satan, were distracted and dissatisfied. The bringing of Christ's gospel to any place or individual is a matter of great joy to that place or person. 
Act 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Conversion of Saul of Tarsus. Paul preaches and visits Jerusalem and returns to Tarsus. Peter heals Aeneas. Tabitha raised from the dead. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Holy Spirit, Saul, disciples, high priest, Ananias, Judas, Barnabas, Peter, Aeneas, Dorcas, Simon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Saul, v. 1.<br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 20. One who has been filled with the Holy Ghost is sure to preach Christ, that He is the Son of God. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is no need to despair of the conversion of those who commit the worst outrages against Christianity, for the power of the Lord Jesus is able to break down the stubborn will of one who is at the same time chief of legalists and chief of sinners. God chooses the instruments He would employ in His service, and is able to fit them for His designs by the power of His Spirit. 
Act 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Peter opens the gospel door to the Gentiles. Cornelius sends for Peter and Peter goes to Caesarea. Peter's sermon to Gentiles in Cornelius' house.

All men shall be accountable to Jesus Christ as Judge if they will not receive Him as Savior. He alone determines the everlasting condition of all men at the great day. Those who believe in His Name may rest assured that there will be no condemnation for them. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In Jesus Christ, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision availeth anything, for by His finished work, the door of the gospel has been opened to "whosoever believeth." Whatever nation one may be of, though far remote from the seed of Abraham, though ever so despicable, that will be no prejudice to him, if he will receive God's appointed sacrifice for the remission of sins. 
Act 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Peter vindicates his ministry to the Gentiles. Name "Christians" first applied at Antioch. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Spirit, Peter, angel, John, Stephen, Barnabas, Saul, Agabus, Caesar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Antioch Christians, vv. 22, 26. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 26. The name "Christians" cannot be, as some claim, a nickname. The Holy Spirit would not draw attention to the epithets of a jeering crowd and let it pass down the centuries as their accredited name. The name was certainly divinely chosen, for it puts emphasis on "Christ" (anointed One) rather than the human name of our Lord, in which case we would have been called "Jesuits." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - As Christians travel the Gospel spreads, and where God's Word takes root, the hand of the Lord goes with it to give the tokens of His  good will and the evidences of His work among them by the Holy Spirit.   
Act 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Persecutions of the church and arrest of Peter. Prayer for his deliverance and his miraculous release. Death of Herod. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Herod, James, Peter, 2 soldiers, angel, Mary, Mark, Rhoda, Blastus, Barnabas, Saul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Delivered, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Times of public distress and danger should be especially praying times for the church. However God's people are surrounded, there is al-  ways a way open heavenward, nor can the strongest bars intercept His power. God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Times of public distress and danger should be especially praying times for the church. However God's people are surrounded, there is always a way open heavenward, nor can the strongest bars intercept His power. God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think. 
Act 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul and Barnabas called. Satanic opposition from a sorcerer. Paul's sermon in the synagogue at Antioch. Opposition from Jews. Paul and Barnabas turn to Gentiles. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Barnabas, Simeon, Lucius, Manaen, Herod, Paul, Bar-jesus, Sergius Paulus, Satan, Mark, Saul, David, John the Baptist, Abraham, Pilate. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Word published, vv. 5, 44, 49. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 26, 38, 39, 47. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 33. The resurrection of Jesus Christ was the great proof of His being the Son of God with power, and was the confirmation of all that was prophesied about Him, and the ratification of His divine commissions. His resurrection is proven v. 31. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who have been separated to Christ and the Holy Ghost will have the presence of the Holy Ghost with them to strengthen them, carry forward their work and give success to the Word preached. Those thus called may venture upon the stormy sea of persecution for Christ's sake as if it was a quiet harbor, having great joy in the sowing of the Word and confidence that He will bless it to His own glory. 
Act 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Work of the Gospel at Iconium, Derbe, Lystra. An impotent man at Lystra healed. Paul stoned. Elders appointed in the churches. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Paul, Barnabas, impotent man, priest of Jupiter. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Giving testimony, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. There is only one man who can, without idolatry, be worshiped Jesus, the Christ who was "God manifest in the flesh." "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and Him only." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who speak boldly in the Lord need not think it strange, if the preaching of the Gospel occasions divisions, nor be offended by the insults heaped upon them by embittered and convicted spirits. They shall be made strong in the Lord and in the power of His might, and God shall confirm their testimony in granting wonders to be done by their hands. 
Act 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The council at Jerusalem and the question of circumcision. Paul's second missionary journey. Silas chosen. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Moses, Paul, Barnabas, apostles, elders, Pharisees, Peter, James, Simeon, David, Judas, Silas, Mark. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Council, vv. 6, 25. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 14, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. This is one of the most important passages in the New Testament, stating the divine program for the church in this dispensation. It is not the conversion of the world through the different agencies of reform, but the taking out of the world of an elect people who shall make up the Body or Bride of Christ. The Gospel everywhere calls out some, but it never, in any place, has been known to convert all, and nothing of this order is to be expected in this age. The work of the church is soul winning. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who are ever so well taught have need to stand upon their guard that they be not untaught again, and having known liberty in Christ Jesus should again be brought into bondage to law which cannot save.   
Act 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul finds Timothy. Paul's Macedonian vision. The first convert in Europe. Demons cast out of a damsel. Paul and Silas beaten. Conversion of the Philippian jailer. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Holy Spirit, Paul, Timothy, Lydia, a damsel, Silas, prison keeper, magistrates, sergeants. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Called (v. 10) and kept (vv. 25, 27). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 31. Here is the sum of the whole Gospel, the covenant of grace in a nutshell. It is the only way to salvation. Admit the record that God has given in His Gospel concerning His Son, assent to it as faithful and worthy of acceptation, receive Jesus Christ as He is offered to us in the Gospel, and give up yourself to be saved and ruled by Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The movements of God's servants and the dispensing of the means of grace by them are in a particular manner under a divine guidance and direction, and those who are under the check and conduct of the Spirit, though they be called upon to suffer much for Jesus' sake, may be sure God will in some way get glory to Himself by their testimony and persecutions. 
Act 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Founding of church at Thessalonica and the Jewish opposition. Paul and Silas at Berea. Paul at Athens and the sermon from Mars' hill. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Paul, Silas, Jason, Caesar, philosophers, Dionysius, Damaris. <br><b>Key Word</b> - (Scriptural) Reasoning, vv. 2, 1L, 22. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 24, 25, 26, 28, 31. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. The scope of all preaching is to point to Jesus Christ as the One who made atonement and was resurrected for the justification of all who will believe. Jesus must be the subject of all preaching, and our business is to bring people to acquaintance with Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The doctrine of Christ does not fear a scrutiny, but will be borne out fully by the light of all Scripture. Those who reason from the Scriptures concerning "Christ crucified" may expect not only that God will incline some to make use of the means of grace by searching the Scriptures for themselves, but that the enmity of the restless agents of Satan will be aroused. Nevertheless, by seeking to extinguish the divine fire, enemies will but spread it the farther a ad faster. 
Act 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul at Corinth. The careless Gallio. Paul takes a Jewish vow. Apollos at Ephesus. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Paul, Aquila, Priscilla, Claudius, Silas, Timothy, Justus, Crispus, Gallio, Sosthenes, Apollos, John the Baptist. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Testifying (v. 5) and reasoning (vv. 4, 19). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 5, 28. Too much cannot be said of the necessity, in our preaching or witnessing, of preaching "not ourselves, but Christ Jesus, the Lord," teaching men from the Scriptures the great fundamental doctrine of His deity. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let the Gospel be propagated, not by force, but by fair argument, meeting the reasonings of sinners with ready answers from the Scriptures. It is always our duty to testify with all solemnity to Christ's deity, especially where men speak reproachful!?; of Him, thus making ourselves clean from the blood of their souls. Those who have Christ with them need not shrink from pleading the cause of heaven with boldness. 
Act 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul at Ephesus. Disciples of John the Baptist become Christians. Paul in the synagogue and in the school of Tyrannus. Paul's miracles. Uproar of the silversmiths. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Holy Spirit, Apollos, Paul, John the Baptist, Tyrannus, Sceva, his seven sons, Timothy, Erastus, Demetrius, Gaius, Aristarchus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Disputing and persuading, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 10, 20. The Gospel is Christ's Word. To preach from the Scriptures without preaching Christ is to miss the result in v. 20, the prevailing mightily in the hearts of men. It is Christ in our preaching Who goes on conquering and to conquer. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let Christ's witnesses speak undauntedly with holy resolution, as those who have not the least doubt of the things they speak of, nor the least distrust of the power of Him they speak from, nor the least dread of those they speak to. While some will oppose the Gospel because it calls many off from their sinful employments, it will lead many to true contrition for sin and confession of Christ. 
Act 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul goes to Macedonia and Greece. His visits at Troas, Miletus. Paul's conference with the Ephesian elders. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Holy Spirit, Paul, Sopater, Aristarchus, Secundus, Gaius, Timothy, Tychicus, Trophimus, Eutychus, elders. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Testifying, vv. 21, 24. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 20, 24, 27, 28, 32, 35. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 28. The priceless cost of redemption is here seen the blood of God. See 1 Tim. 3:16. Christ's deity is thereby asserted. His blood was of infinite value being God's blood. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - As witnesses of the grace of God through Jesus Christ, we ought not to hold our lives of any account to ourselves in comparison with accomplishing our course and declaring the whole counsel of God. Being ourselves made pure by the blood of the Son of Man, it behooves us to make ourselves pure from the blood of the sons of men. 
Act 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Holy Spirit forbids Paul to go to Jerusalem. Paul goes to Jerusalem. Paul takes a Jewish vow. Seized in the temple by the Jews and bound with chains. <br><b>Characters</b> - Paul, Holy Spirit, Philip, his four daughters, Manson, James, Moses, Trophimus, police captain. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Warnings disregarded, vv. 4, 11, 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 36. As men cried "Crucify Him" and "away with Him" at Christ Himself, though they could not say what evil He had done, so they will often treat His ambassadors and -desire to chase them out of the world. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Disregard of any details of the leading of the Holy Spirit leads into a multitude of difficulties that might have been avoided. God often protests the most devoted acts of some of His servants, even acts of self sacrifice, and would save them from bringing their greater usefulness to an abrupt end; nevertheless He is able to overrule their mistakes and bring good out of them to men and glory to Himself. 
Act 22:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul's defense before the multitude. Recounts his conversion. Characters: God, Jesus, Paul, Ananias, chief captain. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Paul, Ananias, chief captain. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Experience, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. There is a three-fold preparation for the service of Christ. 1. To know His will. 2. To have a vision of Christ, the Just One, crucified. 3. To hear His voice.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's servants who are set upon with rage and fury because of their teachings concerning Christ cannot offer a better defense of their doctrine than to relate their own vital experience with the saving power of Jesus Christ. Christianity is not an argument but a life.  
Act 23:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul before the Sanhedrin. The conspiracy to kill Paul and its defeat. Paul sent to Felix. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Paul, Ananias, Pharisees, Sadduces, Paul's sister's son, centurion, chief captain, Lysias, Felix. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Dissension (v. 7) and conspiracy (v. 13). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - It is the will of Christ that His servants should often suffer with Him, but in their trials He would have them to be "cheerful," and in the consciousness of His presence, how can one be otherwise? If He is with us, all secular events will be ordered to give opportunity to witness for Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Many are the troubles of the righteous, but some way or other, the Lord delivereth them out of them all. God is able to bring the hidden things to light and make conspirators' own tongues betray them, and above all to make the persecutions of His servants to turn to the wider spread of the Gospel. 
Act 24:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul accused before Felix, and his defense. <br><b>Characters</b> - Ananias, elders, Tertullus, Felix, Paul, Lysias, Drusilla, Festus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Accused, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. It is nothing new for the Scriptural and right way to worship to be called "heresy." Jesus Christ Himself was called a heretic. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Every false cause can find men of sharp wits to plead it. The truest Christian life is no fence against the hatred of the rejectors of Christ (John 15:18), but if God's servants can speak with the language of a clear conscience, they need have no fear. "The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them." 
Act 25:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul before Festus. His appeal to Caesar. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Festus, high priest, Paul, Caesar, Agrippa, Bernice. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Falsely accused, vv. 5, 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 19. What Paul affirmed concerning Jesus Christ, that He is alive, is a matter of such vast importance, that if it be not true, we are all undone. Yet many men today treat the subject slightly as did this Roman. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is nothing for the most excellent ones of the earth to have all manner of evil said against them falsely for Christ's sake and to be represented even in courts as odious and harmful to society. Nevertheless God is able to make men's worldly policies serve His own purpose (Psa. 76:10), and when enemies think to block the gates of the Gospel, He is able to open them wider. 
Act 26:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul's defense before Agrippa. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Paul, Agrippa, Satan, Festus, Bernice, Caesar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Defense, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 18, 28, 29. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 23. Three great Gospel fundamentals to be continually emphasized. 1. That Jesus Christ was appointed to suffering and the cross. 2. That He should be the chief of the resurrection, making way for the resurrection of the saints. 3. That He arose to show a light to those in darkness, and by the power of His resurrection to give convincing proof of the truth of His doctrine. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When God's servant is given a chance to speak for himself, it is well if he may speak for Christ instead, nor need he be ashamed of the Gospel of Christ in any company. Though they answer with scorn and contempt, it is certain that God will in some way use the testimony for I glory. 
Act 27:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul sent to Rome. The hurricane. God's assurance to Paul in the storm, and his safe landing. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Paul, Julius, centurion, angel, Caesar. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Storm, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 23, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - What Paul was in the ship, Christians should be in the world. If Christ is the senior member of our firm, we shall be able in the midst of the storms of earth to take upon ourselves great responsibilities, and by the power of prayer to save many a situation to the glory of God. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Worldly men insist on being guided by human prudence, but the Christian who is in communion with Jesus, the great Pilot, may know more about sailing than any unpraying Captain could ever know. Since God has promised to be faithful to His own in the storms, let them be cheerful in the storms, knowing that while He has work for them to do, no difficulty can get in the way. 
Act 28:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The landing at Melita. Miracle of the viper's bite. Healing of Publius' father. Paul's arrival at Rome and his ministry there to the Jews. Paul turns to the Gentiles. <br><b>Characters</b> - Jesus, Holy Spirit, Paul, Publius, Captain, Centurion, soldier, Caesar, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Healing (v. 9) and teaching (v. 31). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 25, 26, 27, 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 31. Paul stuck to his text "Jesus Christ" to the end. Let those who are tempted to diverge from that which is their main business to "preach not ourselves but Christ" ask themselves of what concern it is to Jesus Christ and His kingdom, to preach anything but HIM. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Wherever in the providence of God the Christian is put, he is placed there to do a work for God and to represent Jesus Christ. Blessing may come to thousands out of seeming calamity that befalls God's true servants. God's ways are past finding out, but let His servant be confident always in His promises and ready to do every good work wherever the waves of events may land him. 
Rom 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Words of comfort to the church at Rome. The universe a revelation of the power and deity of God. The deplorable condition of a lost world. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Carnality, v. 24. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 16, 19, 20, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. The demonstration of the deity of Jesus Christ is His resurrection from the dead. The sign of the prophet Jonah (Matt. 12:39) was intended for the last conviction. Those who will not be convinced by that will not be convinced by anything. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God has made Himself known to all men by the things of His creation. Though men know He exists and might infer that it was their duty to worship Him only, they glorify Him not as God, but ascribe deity to the most contemptible of creatures and give themselves over to vile affections. Those who thus dishonor Him, will be given up eventually to dishonor themselves. 
Rom 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The equal standing of Jew and Gentile before the justice of God. Morality apart from Christ useless as means of salvation. Jews knowing the law condemned by the law. <br><b>Characters</b> - God. <br><b>Key Word</b> - No partiality (No respect of persons )v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. The riches of His goodness are described in Eph, 1:7 "redemption through the blood of Christ and forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace." However moral or religious a man be, if he has despised this divine plan he is lost. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - All men, Jew or Gentile, good or bad, are under doom for breaking the righteous law of God the heathen who are sinners and know it (1:18-32) the self-righteous who think they need no salvation (2:1-11), and the religionist who makes a mere profession (2:17-29) all stand on the same level before the justice of God and all in need of the salvation God has provided. 
Rom 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The common guilt of both Jew and Gentile. Justification by faith, not by the law. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - All under sin, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 10, 11, 12, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 22. The gospel excludes none that do not exclude them selves by refusing to appropriate the finished work of Jesus Christ. The best brand of self-righteousness will not stand before God. We must wear the righteousness which God has ordained and which is brought in by His Son. All men alike are welcome to God through Jesus Christ. He  has but one plan of salvation.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The sum of all sin is coming short of the glory of God for which we were created therefore all the world stands guilty before God, unable by any works to gain acceptance with God. Justification before God is resolved thereby purely into the free grace of God through Jesus Christ to all who will receive it as a free gift. 
Rom 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Abraham justified by faith, not works. Justifying faith defined. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Abraham, David, Sarah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Justifying faith, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 7, 8, 16, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 24-25. Christ's death and resurrection are the two main hinges on which the door of salvation turns. He was delivered as our sacrifice for sin. He was raised for the perfecting and completing of our justification. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - No man can pretend to merit eternal life, nor show any worth in his work which may answer such a reward. Disclaiming any pretension he must cast himself wholly upon the free grace of God by faith in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. To such a one faith is counted for righteousness. 
Rom 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The results of justification. Life and righteousness through Jesus Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Adam, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Justification, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. The dying Jesus laid the foundation, satisfying for sin, but it is the living Jesus that perfects the work He lives to make intercession. By His death He saves from penalty by His life from the power of sin. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Justification through faith in Jesus Christ takes away guilt and so makes way for peace, and gives access into the wondrous grace of God. Through Jesus Christ alone the believer comes into fullness of joy, being saved from wrath, solaced in His love, not only going to heaven, but going triumphantly. 
Rom 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Deliverance from the power of indwelling sin by counting the old life dead, and yielding to the new life. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Dead to sin, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 13, 16, 22, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 3-6. The manner of Christ's baptism is a figure of the believer's spiritual burial and resurrection. Immersion symbolizes the entrance by the gateway of Christ's death into the domain of His righteousness and resurrection life, and is the expression of the baptized one's faith that God has taken him from among the dead and given him newness of life. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is an abuse of the grace of God in Christ for the believer to think he can sin because he is justified by faith. We must cease from the acts of sin, denying the fleshly life the scepter over us, and surrender the soul to the conduct and command of the righteous law of God that our members may be instruments of righteousness unto God. 
Rom 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The conflict of the flesh with the spiritual nature. Impossibility of victory through the law. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sold under sin, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 12, 13, 23, 24, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The believer upon acceptance of Christ receives a spiritual nature which begins at once strife with the Adamic nature, which is not eradicated until we stand in Christ's presence. The strife is effectually taken up on the believer's behalf by the Holy Spirit, and if the believer will but yield to Him in the hour of conflict, He will take the victory (8:2; Gal. 5:16-17). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The function of the law is to detect and condemn sin, not to deliver from it. In the life of the believer there will ever be conflict between grace and corruption fn the heart, between the law of God and the law of sin. Who shall deliver us? Jesus Christ is the all-sufficient Saviour and Friend, who has not only purchased our deliverance, but is our advocate in Heaven, through Whom we may be made victorious. 
Rom 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The new law of the Holy Spirit in the believer, giving deliverance from sinful nature. The full result of the Gospel in the believer and his security. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Made free, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 14, 16, 18, 26, 28, 31, 32, 34, 35, 38, 39. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 26, 34. The security of the believer as to the Denalty of sin rests upon the one foundation of Christ's finished work (v. 32) and His intercession in heaven for the believer. The believer's security against the power of sin is the present work of the Holy Spirit within him and His intercession for us. Notice the two intercessors. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is the unspeakable comfort of all those who are in Christ Jesus that no condemnation remains to them, and that the indwelling Spirit does in the believer what the law never could do. He gives deliverance from the power of sin, quickens for service, imparts assurance, and inspires prayer. 
Rom 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Covenants of Israel not set aside by Gospel. The seven-fold privilege of Israel. The blinding of Israel and God's mercy to the Gentiles. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Moses, Pharaoh, Paul, Rebecca, Isaiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Election, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 20, 21, 33. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 33. It is sad that the foundation stone should be to any a stone of stumbling, and the rock of salvation a rock of offense, but so He was to the Jews, and is still to multitudes. Those who do believe, however, shall not be ashamed, for their expectations in Him shall never be disappointed. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God is absolute sovereign in disposing of the children of men with reference to their eternal state. He dispenses His gifts to whom He will without giving us His reasons, but we may rest assured He is a competent judge. Gentiles are permitted by Him, by the short cut of believing in Christ, to attain to that for which the Jews had long been "beating about the bush," but lost because of sin and unbelief. 
Rom 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Israel's failure explained by unbelief. The plan of salvation. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Moses, Isaiah, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Salvation, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. The law is not destroyed by the Gospel, but full satisfaction being made to the law by Jesus Christ (no one else could), for our breach of the law, the end is attained, and we are put in another way of justification, even faith in His finished work. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Sincerity is not a ground of safety; self-righteousness is not a ground of salvation. The design of the law was to lead people to Christ, Who is the end of it, and the only ground for salvation is to become interested by humble faith in Christ's satisfaction of the law, and so be "justified through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." 
Rom 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - A spiritual Israel finding salvation. National Israel blinded. Warning to Gentiles. Israel yet to be saved nationally. Characters: God, Jesus, Paul, Elijah, David, Abraham. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Paul, Elijah, David, Abraham. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Israel, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 18, 21, 22, 25, 26, 32, 33, 36. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 25-26. The Church is a people taken from the Gentiles (Acts 15:14) and is a "full destined number" (Rev. 7:9). When the "fullness of the Gentiles" (not world conversion) is brought in, Christ is coming again, and will be soon manifested as Israel's long looked-for Deliverer. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Jews, at present cast off because of unbelief, will in due time as a people be taken into God's favor again, when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in and when the Deliverer (Christ) shall have appeared again. As a people they are for this age judicially blinded, although there is a remnant according to faith in Christ. The Gentiles grafted into the Church must not trample upon the Jews as a reprobate people, but remember that the law of faith excludes all boasting, either of ourselves or against others. 
Rom 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christian life and service. Consecration to Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Consecration (present bodies), v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 12, 13, 19, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. The reference to "sacrifice" no doubt connects Lev. 1:6-9. The burnt offering typifies Christ offering Himself to God in perfect devotion to the Father's will. The offerer or the Priest got nothing of it it was all devoted to God. So the believer is to live a life completely dedicated to Him in which He has absolute right of way. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Since we have been justified through grace, by faith in Christ, it is our first duty to surrender ourselves to God a living sacrifice, that there may be a saving change wrought in us and that we might be made serviceable in every way to our fellow men. We stand in relation not only to Christ, but to one another in Christ, and we are engaged to do all the good we can one to another and to act in conjunction for the common benefit. 
Rom 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Believer's attitude toward civil government. Law of love toward neighbors. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Subjection, v. 1, and love, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 7, 8, 10, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. Victory over the flesh may be always ours through personal dealings with Christ. To "put on Christ" is not imitation of Christ, but appropriation of Him. "Christ liveth in me" is the victory and if He has the right of way in us, we will make no provisions for satisfying the flesh. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Obedience to civil magistrates is one of the laws of Christ whose religion makes people good subjects. Love to our fellow-men is a debt that must always be in the paying, yet always owing, for love is inclusive of all duties and is the image of Christ upon the soul. 
Rom 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Law of love concerning doubtful things. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judging, vv. 4, 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 8-9. To the Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom all judgment is committed, we are to do everything. To this end, He both died and arose, that He might be Lord of those who are living to rule them, and Lord of the dead to raise them up. We are therefore, answerable to Him in everything. Let us not intrench upon His right by arraigning our brothers at  our own bar.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - To do what conscience allows is not always right and to do what it questions is always wrong. The strong Christian should not be contemptuous toward the opinion of a weaker brother on a doubtful question, neither should the weaker man be censorious toward the stronger because of what conscience allows him. Both have a right to opinion and both are responsible to God for it. 
Rom 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Jewish and Gentile believers under one salvation. Paul speaks of His ministry and coming journey. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Paul, Isaiah. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Gospel unity, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 4, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 5. "According to Christ Jesus." Let Jesus Christ be the center of your unity. If in tune with Him, we will surely be in tune with each other, and we shall agree in truth rather than in error. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The self-denial of our Lord Jesus Christ is the best argument against the selfishness of Christians. Let us not consult our own credit, ease, safety or pleasure, but give ourselves as He did, to bearing the infirmities of the weak, whether they be Jew or Gentile, agreeable or disagreeable, and striving to be likeminded in the Gospel to the glory of God. 
Rom 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The outflow of Christian love. Closing salutations and benediction. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Paul, many of the gospel helpers, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Greetings, v. 3, etc. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 17, 18, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 17-18. Mark the believers attitude toward men who bring in doctrines contrary to Jesus Christ. We are to MARK them (See Isa.8:20). We are to AVOID them (2 Tim. 3:5; 2 John 10). We are not to go to listen to them, nor admit them into the house to argue with them.  This is the Scriptural plan for resisting their teachings.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Courtesy and Christianity go together. Acknowledgment of favors and greetings of love are returns we should make to our fellow laborers in the Gospel for their joy and encouragement.  
1Co 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christians' position in grace. The unspiritual condition of the Corinthian saints. Danger of following human leaders and exulting in human wisdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Paul, Sosthenes, Apollos, Cephas, Chloe, Crispus, Gaius, Stephanas. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Human wisdom, vv. 17, 18. Contentions, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 18, 21, 27, 28, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 23. The plain preaching of a crucified Jesus is more powerful than all the oratory and philosophy of an unbelieving world. All the boasted science of the world cannot do -for souls what "Christ crucified" does. All one needs, or can desire, they may have in Him (vv. 30-31). He is made wisdom to the foolish, righteousness to the guilty, sanctification to the corrupt, and redemption to those who are in bonds. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The consideration of being agreed in the great fundamentals of the faith should have extinguished all feuds and divisions about unessential points. Though there is not unity of sentiment, let there ever be unity of affection in the Church. 
1Co 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christian revelation not indebted to human wisdom. Spiritual verities not discoverable to human wisdom. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Spiritual wisdom, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 9, 10, 11, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. "Christ and Him crucified" is the sum and substance of the Gospel. To display the banner of the cross and invite people under it should be the principal business of the ministers. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Christian on his knees can see farther than the philosopher on his tiptoes, for spiritual truth can be perceived only by the spiritually prepared mind. The truths of God are foolishness and trifling to a carnal mind. The only way to understand spiritual truth is to yield to the Author of it, the Holy Spirit. 
1Co 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Hindrance of a carnal state to spiritual growth. Christian service and its reward. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Apollos, Cephas. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Labor, reward, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 11, 13, 16, 19, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 11. The doctrine of Jesus Christ and His mediation is the principal doctrine of Christianity. Those who build hopes of heaven on any other foundation build upon sinking sands, v. 23. Those who would be safe for time and happy for eternity, must be Christ's. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Our salvation rests solely upon the completed work of Jesus Christ, but rewards are to be earned by spiritual service for God, and will be according to the quality of our works. True service done in the power of the indwelling Spirit, is of eternal standing, but fleshly service is perishable and will bring the Christian loss of reward at the final day. 
1Co 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Judgment of Christ's servants not committed to man. Apostolic example of patience and humility. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Apollos, Timothy. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judging, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 5, 20. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's steward awaits no judgment of man, but stands or falls by his Master's judgment his standard being fidelity to God, not popularity  with men.  
1Co 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Immorality rebuked and discipline enjoined. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Paul, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fornication, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 7-8. Christ was the fulfillment of the Jewish Passover. After the lamb was killed they kept the feast of unleavened bread. So must we, not only seven days, but all our days. The world life of the Christian must be one of "unleavened bread" sincerity and truth. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The heinous sins of professed Christians are quickly noted and noised abroad to the injury of Christ's cause. Let the believer walk circumspectly, for many eyes are upon him, and if he will not do so let the Church have no fellowship with him. 
1Co 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Saints forbidden to go to law with each other. Sanctity of the body. The body the Lord's temple. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Going to law, v. 1. The Body, v. 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 20. Christ has purchased the believer, body, soul and spirit by His own blood. Let, us therefore, be careful what we do with another's property. Let our bodies be kept as His whose they are and fit for His use and residence. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Contention of Christians before the law is much to the reproach of Christianity. It is a forgetting of their real dignity as Christians to carry little matters about the things of life before heathen magistrates. 
1Co 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Sanctity of marriage. Regulation of marriage among Gentile believers. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Marriage, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 39. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Marriage is by divine wisdom prescribed for the preventing of fornication. Man and wife cannot separate at pleasure, nor for any other cause than what Christ allows, for it is a divine institution and is a compact for life by God's appointment. Even though a Christian has been united to an unbeliever, before having accepted Christ, they are one flesh, they are to abide together and the believing one is to be sanctified for the sake of the unbelieving one. 
1Co 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Meats offered to idols, and the limitations of Christians' liberty. Characters: God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Christian liberty, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3, 6, 9, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 12. Injuries done to Christians are injuries done to Christ especially to babes in Christ weak Christians.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There is nothing in the distinction of food that will make any distinction between men in God's account, and the Christian is free to eat that 
1Co 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul vindicates his apostleship. The method and reward of true ministry and the support of the ministry. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Cephas, Barnabas, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Ministry, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14, 19, 22, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 27. The word "castaway" is literally "disapproved," and so translated in other places. He is not expressing fear that he may fail of salvation but is speaking of service, and the possibility through unfaithfulness, of being laid on the shelf. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is no new thing for ministers of Christ to meet with the worst treatment where they might expect the best. Those who enjoy benefits by the ministry of the Word should not grudge the maintenance of those who are employed in this work. It is to the praise of a minister, nevertheless, to prefer the success of his ministry and the salvation of souls, to his own interest and to deny himself that he may serve Christ. 
1Co 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Israel in the wilderness, a warning example. Fellowship of the Lord's table demands separation. Law of love in relation to eating and drinking. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Temptation, v. 13. Communion, vv. 16, 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 12, 13, 16, 20, 23, 31, 33. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 16. The ceremony of the Lord's supper is a token whereby we professedly hold communion with Him whose body was broken and blood shed to procure remission of our sins and the favor of God. vv. 3, 4. He is that Bread which came down from heaven. He is the Rock out of which refreshing streams come to the believer. It is impossible to be in alliance with Him without being devoted to Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We should take warning from those who have gone before us, that carnal desires are the source and root of much sin and if not checked we know not whither they will carry us. 
1Co 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christian order and the Lord's supper. Meaning of the Lord's table. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Covered heads, v. 4. Lord's supper, v. 20. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 19, 23-27, 31, 32. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 25. New covenant. These outward signs express the new covenant in Christ His body broken, His blood shed, the benefits which flow from His death and sacrifice. His blood is the seal and sanction of all the privileges of the new covenant. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Lord's supper is a memorial of His finished atonement, a parable of His present fellowship with His own and a prophecy of His second coming. The ordinances of Christ are very solemn and if they do not do our souls good, will do us harm. Let it not be eaten carelessly or with an insincere heart for it will turn to no account, but to increase guilt and bring condemnation. 
1Co 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Spiritual gifts in the Body of Christ, for ministry and worship. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Gifts, vv. 1, 30. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 7, 13, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 13. The baptism with the Spirit forms the Body by uniting believers to Christ, the risen and glorified Head, and to each other. Regeneration is a participation in the baptism of Pentecost when the Body of Christ was first organized. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Body of Christ in the world is for the service for, and manifestation of Christ, and the Body is to serve the Head, whose Body we are. The gifts and graces of the members of the Body greatly differ, but are freely given of God through the Holy Spirit. Since all powers in the members proceed from the Holy Ghost, no member may boast against another, and no member, however insignificant, may consider himself unessential, but is equally obligated to be yielded to the Spirit. 
1Co 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Love, the supreme gift of the Spirit, and its governing power over other gifts. <br><b>Characters</b> - Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Love, v. 1 (charity). <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1-3, 12, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Jesus Christ was the supreme expression of the love of God and His divine love and compassion is the gift of the Spirit to believers who will be yielded to Him. Thinking of Jesus as "love" (for God is love) substitute the name Jesus in place of "charity" and notice the force of the text. Can you say "Christ liveth in me?" <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Love alone can give value to any service rendered in Christ's name, and it is therefore the supreme gift of the Spirit, to be coveted and prayed for above all others. Faith trusts and appropriates, hope expects, but love expresses Christ and blesses men. 
1Co 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Prophecy and speaking in tongues. The order of the ministry of this gift in the church. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Gift of tongues, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 8, 9, 12, 19, 33. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - All believers have the Holy Spirit 1 Cor. 6:19-20, not all were to have tongues 12:28-30. All public display of the gift, if it is given by the Spirit, is for edification, 14:5-28, always accompanied by interpretation, 14:13, 23-26, 28, always under control, 14:27. If accompanied by confusion, it is not of the Spirit, 14:33-40. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - That is the best and most eligible gift which best answers the purposes of charity and edifies the church. That which cannot be understood cannot edify, and such confusion is to be avoided in the church. No gift of the Spirit is to be despised, and if the gift of tongues is bestowed, it will be with interpretation among two or three brethren, and will result in their blessing. 
1Co 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The resurrection of Christ and the resurrection of believers resulting from it. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Cephas, James, Adam. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Resurrection, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 14, 17, 20, 22, 23, 42, 43, 44, 47, 49, 51, 58. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - If Christ's body lies in some nameless grave, there is no hope for the believer, and the Gospel is nothing but emptiness. How do we know His sacrifice for sin was accepted? How can we hope for our own resurrection and immortality? "In Christ shall all be made alive" (v. 22), but notice that the word "all" is defined "they that are Christ's" (v. 23). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The resurrection of Christ, together with His atoning work is the cornerstone of all Christian doctrine. It is the evidence that sin has been effectually put away, the ground for saving faith and the promise that all united to the Body of Christ shall be raised at His coming to receive a glorious body like unto His own, and to bear forever the image of the heavenly. 
1Co 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Closing instructions and greetings of Paul. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Paul, Timothy, Apollos, Aquila, Priscilla, Stephanas, Fortunatus, Achaicus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Instruction. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Christian should lay by money in store for good uses, having a treasury for this purpose a stock for others as well as for themselves. They should be ready to every good work as opportunity offers, whether it be in giving or in assisting in some other way the servants of Christ. 
2Co 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul's interest in the Corinthian Christians and his encouragement to them in Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Timothy, Silvanus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Consolation, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 5, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 5. When we truly share the sufferings of Christ, we have in Him peace in the midst of it all, and grace to bear it. The sufferings of the Christian are the sufferings of Christ. He sympathizes with His members when they suffer for His sake. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Man's extremity is God's opportunity. Affliction to the people of God is but a pruning knife to the vine to prepare them for greater usefulness to others. One of the greatest evidences of God's love to His own is to send them afflictions with grace to bear them. 
2Co 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Forgiving those who have fallen into sin. The ministry of the Christian. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Titus, an erring brother, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Forgiveness, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14, 15, 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 15-16. Unto some Christ becomes a savour of death unto death. Because they are willfully obstinate, they are finally blinded and hardened by it. They have rejected it to eternal spiritual death. To the humble and gracious, His Gospel becomes the savour of life unto life, quickening them who were "dead in trespasses and sins." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When a brother is truly penitent for his sin we should not be too rigid or severe with him, lest it give Satan an advantage by driving him to despair, but we should confirm our love to him by forgiving him and showing that our reproofs proceeded from love to his person rather than design to ruin him. 
2Co 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The ministry of Christ accredited. Its spiritual and glorious character. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Ministry, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3, 5, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 18. Those who yield to the working of the Holy Spirit may be made more and more into the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29). The Holy Spirit longs to bring us into conformity to the "family likeness" even  before the hour when we shall see Him face to face and be made like Him.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - True ministers are Christ's instruments, for He is the author of all good that is in them and His love and His likeness are revealed in them by the Holy Spirit. They are ministers, not merely of the letter to read the written Word or to preach the letter of the Gospel only, but ministers of the Spirit also. The Spirit accompanies their ministrations and reveals Christ through their lives. 
2Co 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Truth taught, commended by the life. The preaching of the Lordship of Christ. The suffering of true ministers with Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Ministry, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 16, 17, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 13-14. A great sustaining power for the persecuted servant of Christ is the hope of resurrection through Him. This hope will save us from sinking. We know that Christ was raised and His resurrection is an earnest and assurance of ours. What reason has a Christian to fear death who dies in hope of being raised by the Lord Jesus? <br><b>Conclusion</b> - A steadfast adherence to the truths of the Gospel, backed by constancy and sincerity, will commend the servant of God to the opinion of wise men. They should not be of proud spirit, but realize that they themselves are but vessels of little worth and in their perplexities for Christ's sake let them know that God is able to support them and in Him they should ever trust and hope. 
2Co 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Why death has no terrors for the Lord's servant. The motive and object of ministry for Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Servant's hope, v. 1, and Motive, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 21. Christ was "made sin" not a sinner, but sin a sinoffering or sacrifice. As He Who knew no sin was made sin for us, so we who have no righteousness of our own are made the righteousness of God in Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The servant of God who has the earnest of the Spirit to give everlasting grace and comfort, with a promise of a glorious resurrection body and the eternal fellowship of the Lord Jesus Himself, cannot but despise the brief sufferings and persecutions of this life, and be constrained by the love of Christ, manifested in the great instance of His dying for us, to persevere in testifying as ambassadors of heaven, to lost men. 
2Co 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul's ministry to the . Corinthians. Appeal to separation and cleansing. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Separation, v. 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 14, 16, 17. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The ministers of the Gospel should look upon themselves as God's servants and act in everything suitably to that character. As they are themselves so let them seek to make the followers of Christ under their charge, not only by profession, but in reality, the temples of the Holy Ghost, dedicated to and employed for the service of God and separated from all uncleanness. 
2Co 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul opens his heart to the Corinthians concerning purpose of his former letter. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Paul, Titus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sorrow to repentance, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The true servant of God cannot but be grieved that he must rebuke Christians for sin, nor can he shun to make those sorry for a season whom he would rather make glad. If the offenders will but let their sorrow work true repentance, God's minister may rejoice in the nature of their sorrow when it is turned again to joy that is durable. 
2Co 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Collection for the poor. Exhortation concerning the grace of giving. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Titus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Liberality, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 9, 12, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 9. Our Lord Jesus, equal in power and glory with the Father, rich in all the glory and blessedness of the upper world, yet for our sakes became, literally, "a beggar." We are thereby made rich in the blessings and promises of the new covenant and the hopes of eternal life. Shall we hold on to our dollars when they are needed for His cause? The best arguments for Christian duties are those taken from the love Christ has manifested to us. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who truly love the Lord Jesus Who became poor for our sakes, making us rich in eternal things, cannot but dedicate their temporal riches to His disposal for the relief of brethren in Christ who are in need. His rewards for Christian liberality will be based on the will to do, rather than the ability to do, and He takes notice, not of what we give, but what we have left. 
2Co 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Offering for the Jerusalem saints. Encouragement for givers. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Giving, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7, 8, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. The one Gift, Christ, outshines all others and draws all other divine gifts after it (Rom. 8:32). How can one who is in possession of the "unspeakable gift" grudge money for His service? <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Our return in blessings will be proportionate to what we sow. Let our works of charity be therefore done with thought and prayer, rather than by accident, giving cheerfully, not grudgingly, being glad we have ability and opportunity to be charitable. God loveth a cheerful giver, therefore no man can be the loser by doing that with which God is pleased for He is able to make His grace the more abundant toward us. 
2Co 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vindication of Paul's apostleship, and his appeal to Corinthians as brethren in Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Boasting in the Lord, vv. 8, 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 5, 17, 18. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The servants of Christ should be sensible of their own infirmities, thinking humbly of themselves, keeping within their own province and careful to give glory to God in all their work. At the same time let them not betray their authority in Christ. Believers should render humble obedience to them as men set over them by God, not comparing their personal appearance or ways with other popular leaders. 
2Co 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul's godly jealousy for Christ's cause. Warning against false teachers. Paul's enforced boasting. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Satan, Eve, Abraham, Aretas, governor of Damascus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Paul's glorying, vv. 10, 30. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 14, 15, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. The Church is the Bride of Christ, Eph. 5:25-32; Rev. 19:6-8; affianced, yet not married, yet as a Body. The espoused Bride is often found flirting with old lovers of the world, a source of grief to the true Bridegroom. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is no pleasure to a good man to speak well of himself, yet in some cases it is lawful, namely when it is for the advantage of others or for the vindication of the cause of Christ. Those who boast in the Lord can never boast of what they have done, though they may glory in what they have suffered for His sake. Thus are false teachers distinguished from true, for they boast of their works and shun sufferings. 
2Co 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - God's dealing with Paul. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Titus, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Glorying (in Christ), v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 7, 9. The thorns Christ wore for us and with which He was crowned, sanctify and make easy all the thorns in the flesh we may ever be afflicted with. His grace is sufficient and what is health if His grace is not possessed? <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The exalted experiences of the Spirit-filled Christian overbalance all he is called upon to bear for Christ's sake. Whom God loves, He will keep from being exalted above measure, and spiritual burdens will be ordered, with grace to bear them, for the keeping down of spiritual pride. As we communicate our experiences let us remember to take notice of what God has done to humble us, as well as to advance us. 
2Co 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Closing exhortations of Paul to the Corinthians. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Examine yourselves, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 5, 8. 11, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. As Christ was crucified in weakness, or appeared to be weak to men, but lives by the power of God, so His representatives, however contemptible they may seem to some, yet are instruments manifesting the power of God, as proven by the souls regenerated, and will yet be vindicated before all men, by their resurrection unto life eternal in Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The great burden of God's faithful representatives is that the Gospel they preach may be honored, however their persons may be vilified. Their heavenly commission is verified through the lives of those in whom Christ is living with power, having believed in Christ through their ministry. Let us examine ourselves whether we be in the faith. 
Gal 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The Gospel Paul preached, a revelation not tradition. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Peter, James. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Paul's gospel, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. The cross of the Lord Jesus was designed not only to separate us from the penalty of our sins, but to separate us from the power of them. Shall we who have been saved by His grace deny Him by plunging again into that from which His cross has forever delivered us? <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Gospel declared by the apostles was by revelation of Jesus Christ. It is a Gospel of pure grace, and any message that excludes grace or mingles legalism with grace as a means of salvation in under the curse of God and is to be shunned. 
Gal 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul's journey to Jerusalem and His contest for the truth. Justification by faith in Christ without works. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Paul, Barnabas, Titus, Peter, James, Cephas, John. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Gospel of uncircumcision, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 16, 19, 20, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 20. The present aspect of our salvation is Christ living in us by His Holy Spirit. God does not ask us to live the Christian life, but wants us, by yieldedness to Him to let Christ live it in us. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The gospel of grace is one of justification by faith in Christ's finished work apart from deeds of the law. We do not get saved by our works, but we get saved and work. Those who put themselves under the law after seeking justification through Christ take the place of unjustified sinners seeking to be made righteous by law and works, whereas justification is wholly by faith and sanctification wholly Christ living out through our lives. 
Gal 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Gift of Spirit by faith apart from law-works. Man under lawworks is under the law curse. Christ bears the law curse that we might have the faith blessing. The true intent of the law. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Abraham. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Works and faith, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 10, 11, 13, 21, 22, 24, 26. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 13. What Christ suffered FROM men (the cross) was nothing to what He suffered FOR men. The CURSE of the law was more than the CROSS of human suffering. He bore that curse to the full as the divine Son of God, redeeming the believer, both from the curse and the dominion of the law. Law therefore can neither justify a sinner nor sanctify a believer.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The purpose of the law was to give to sin the character of transgression and prove man helpless to save himself not to save man. Man is therefore shut up to faith in the work of Christ our Mediator, as the only avenue of escape from the penalty of a broken law, for Christ has borne the curse of the law for us and we become the children of God through Him, not by any works of our own. 
Gal 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Believers full redemption from the law. Sonship through the Spirit. Dangers of lapsing into legality. Impossibility of mixing law and grace. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Abraham, Hagar, Isaac. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Bondage and grace, vv. 3, 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 5, 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. Jesus, who was truly God, for our sakes became man. He Who was Lord of all took upon Himself the state of subjection and the form of a servant. The one end of all this was to redeem those under the law. He, the perfect One, took what we deserve, that we, the sinners, might get what He deserved. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Law and grace are an impossible mixture, for salvation is wholly by faith in Christ and our sonship is immediately testified to in the heart by the incoming of the Holy Spirit, upon the basis of Christ's finished work as the full satisfaction of the law. Let us not, therefore, fall again in bondage to the legality of the law, which is merely an element of salvation to reveal to us the inveterate sinfulness of our nature and the impossibility of saving ourselves. 
Gal 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Liberty of the believer in Christ, apart from the law. Conflict of flesh and the Spirit. Christian character the result of the Spirit's work not self-effort. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Liberty, vv. 1, 13. Flesh and Spirit, v. 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 6, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. To "fall from grace" is to fall back on legal ordinances and mix law and grace. One who is fallen from grace is not a believer who has lost his salvation by failure to do good works (the popular Methodist explanation), but one who is doing good works and trusting in them as a means of salvation and sanctification. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Since we are justified only by faith in Christ Jesus, not by the righteousness of the law, let us not again stand in fear of and bondage to legal ordinances. While our salvation is settled by the work of Christ, the conflict of sin which still wars in the believer's members, may be settled by yieldedness to the Holy Spirit, Who is present in the believer to subdue the fleshly nature and to bear heavenly fruit through our lives. 
Gal 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The regenerated life as a brotherhood of believers. <br><b>Characters</b> - Holy Spirit, God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Well doing, v. 9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 14. The cross which connects us with God separates us from the world. Having died with Christ we should therefore be done with the world. Having risen with Christ, we are connected with God in a new life. We cannot glory in the benefits Christ's cross secures if we refuse the rejection which His cross involves. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The new life in Christ Jesus is not simply one of being good, but of doing good. It manifests itself, not by taking a "more holy than thou" attitude, but by bearing the burdens of others and seizing every opportunity to help saints and save sinners. 
Eph 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Believer's position in grace. The prayer for knowledge and power. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, God, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Spiritual blessings, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 7, 13, 14, 22, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 22-23. Jesus is Head of the Church which is His Body and His Bride. As Eve was of Adam's body, yet was his bride, so the Church born out of His opened side, is both the Body and the Bride. This gives Him complete disposal of all the affairs of the true Church to the designs of His grace. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer, is vitally united to Jesus Christ by the indwelling Spirit, through the redemptive work of the cross, and has in Him all spiritual blessings, including the assurance of an eternal inheritance and the working of His mighty power in and through him. 
Eph 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Method of Gentile salvation. Jew and Gentile made one body in Christ, a habitation of God through the Spirit. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Reconciliation, v. 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 18, 21, 22. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 7. One great purpose of Christ's salvation is to reveal in ages to come the exceeding riches of God's grace. If all men were saved, it could never be made to appear that we did really deserve to die. In spite of the cross, we, angels, and universe would doubt it. The loss of some men through rejection of Christ sets that doubt at rest and proves to all eternity that those who are saved were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - A state of sin apart from Christ, is a state of spiritual death and bondage to Satan. A great and happy change is possible on the basis of Christ's finished redemption whereby men are quickened to eternal life by faith apart from their own merits. God, the Father, is the Author of the plan, Christ, the Son, laid the foundation, and the Holy Spirit raises the superstructure. 
Eph 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Church, a mystery hidden in past ages. Prayer for inner fullness and knowledge.    <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, God, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Revelation, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 9, 10. The marvelous redemption of men by grace through faith, on the ground of Christ's atonement is to be a lesson eternally to  Satan and his hosts, of the power of God. Angels are made to see how His glory can he displayed in His dealings with sin.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The divine purpose to make of both Jew and Gentile a wholly new thing, the Church, the Body of Christ, was a mystery unrevealed in Old Testament times, the revelation of which was committed to Paul. Nothing is too hard for divine grace to do; what a mighty treasury of mercy, grace, and love is laid up in Christ Jesus, both for Jew and Gentile who will receive Him as their Lord. 
Eph 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Walk and service of the believer in Christ. Ministry of gifts of Christ to His Body. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Holy Spirit, God, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Walk, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 17, 22, 23, 24, 30, 32. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 8. When Christ's body was laid in the grave, His spirit descended into Hades (the abode of departed spirits), and proclaimed the victory of the cross. At His ascension to the Father after three days He delivered from Hades the spirits of the justified and took them to Paradise above, leaving the unsaved spirits in Hades. The spirit of the Christian at death now goes to be with Him above. Phil. 1:23; 2 Cor. 5:9, <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Considering to what state and condition God has called us in Christ Jesus, let us approve ourselves good Christians, living up to our profession and calling. As members of His Body, the Holy Spirit will endue us with spiritual gifts for His service that we might confirm and build up others in the faith and that we might dispense the saving doctrines of His grace to the unsaved. 
Eph 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Walk of the believer as God's child. The believer's warfare as filled with the Spirit. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Worship, vv. 19, 20. Walk, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 32. Concerning life, the Church is the Body of Christ (1:22, 23). Concerning love, the Church is His Bride. Notice it is the "man" who is said to leave his home to be joined unto a wife. Christ left the glory and His Father, and later parted with His earthly mother (Luke 2:35; John 19:26-27) for the redemptive work whereby He could take out from the world a spiritual Bride, of which all true believers are members. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - As members of the family of God, it is our duty to put on the family likeness by walking as obedient children, and in full yieldedness to the Holy Spirit. Only as we are flexible in His hands may we be victorious in our walk, sincere in our worship or successful in our work. 
Eph 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Domestic life of Spirit-filled believers. Warfare of the believer. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Satan, Tychicus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Warfare, vv. 11-12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. The Lord Jesus has met Satan at every point and defeated him. It is therefore dangerous for us to be strong except in Him Who is the Victor. Our natural courage is perfect cowardice; our natural strength is perfect weakness, but our sufficiency is always in Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Christian life is a warfare, a struggle not only with common calamities and inner desires, but with opposing forces of the powers of darkness which seek to destroy the testimony of the believer. It is therefore requisite that the, Christian soldier be stout-hearted and well armed with spiritual weapons which God supplies. The sword of the Spirit and the access of prayer are weapons against which Satan is powerless. 
Phi 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Triumph of the believer over suffering and persecution. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Holy Spirit, God, Paul, Timothy, Epaphroditus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Joyful tribulation, v. 20. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 21, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 6. It is Christ Who begins the good work in us; it is Christ Who carries it on in us 2:12-13; it is Christ Who will ultimately complete that work by transforming us into His own likeness 3:21. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who desire that Christ may be magnified in their bodies have a holy indifference whether it be by life or death and may rejoice in all their tribulations as Christ's witnesses, knowing that the Word of God cannot be imprisoned and that though things do not turn to their comfort in this world, by God's grace, they will be made to turn to the salvation of others. 
Phi 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christ, the believer's pattern, rejoicing in lowly service. The outworking of inworked salvation. The apostolic example. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Holy Spirit, God, Paul, Timothy, Epaphroditus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Humble service, vv. 5-9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 7-8. Jesus was absolutely divine, yet absolutely human. In coming into the world He did not empty Himself of His divine nature or attributes, but only of the outward and visible manifestation of the Godhead the insignia of majesty, He had to empty Himself of His glory or He would have paralyzed the men He came to save. Although equal with God, He took upon Himself the form of a servant for our sakes, that He might meet, as God manifest in the flesh, the death of the cross. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer should be lowly minded and like-minded, in conformity to the example of the Lord Jesus, the great pattern of humility and love in service to man. He humbled Himself in suffering and death for us, not only to satisfy God's justice, but to set us an example that we might follow His steps bearing a resemblance to His life, since we have profited by His death. 
Phi 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christ, the object of the believer's faith, desire and expectation. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Christ, our sufficiency, vv. 7, 10, 20. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 20, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. Christ's resurrection is the evidence of our justification (Rom. 4:24-25); the assurance of our resurrection (1 Cor. 15:14-18); the source of our spiritual power for He was thus constituted the giver of the Holy Spirit (John 7:39; 20:22). Knowing Him, therefore, involves not only justification through His death but sanctification through His life, feeling the transforming efficacy and virtue of His life, through  the Holy Spirit.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let those reckon themselves unspeakable losers, who by adhering to the things of the world and carnal pride, have no interest in the Lord Jesus. He is the object of the believer's faith for a righteousness that is untarnishable, the object of the believer's desire for a fellowship that is incomparable and the object of the believer's expectation for a resurrection body that is immortal. 
Phi 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christ the believer's strength and source of joy and peace. Giver of victory over anxiety. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Euodias, Syntyche, Clement. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Joy, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 6, 7, 8, 13, 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Seven things the believer is here said to have through Jesus Christ: 1. Privilege of prayer to help us v. 6. 2. Peace to keep us v. 7. 3. Presence to accompany us v. 9. 4. Pattern before us v. 8. 5. Policy to calm us v. 11. 6. Power to strengthen us v. 13. 7. Promise to provide for us v. 19. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The believer's hope and prospect through our Lord Jesus Christ, should engage him to be steady, even and constant in his Christian course, rejoicing always in Him through Whom he has the peace of God, the very presence of the God of peace, and promises that should remove all anxious care. He will give strength for all things, whether to do or bear. He will supply every need of the trusting soul. 
Col 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Apostolic greeting and prayer. The superiority of Christ. His reconciling work. The mystery of His indwelling. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Timothy, Epaphras. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Mighty Christ, vv. 11, 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 15-17. Jesus was the visible representation of the visible God, born before anything was created. Creation was bound up with Him as its secret, and by Him, all things earthly, angelic, celestial and infernal were created and do exist. It pleased the Father that all divine perfections should be summed up in Him. Such a One redeemed us and is Head of the Body, the Church. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - He who has reconciled us to God by His blood and made us meet to partake of eternal happiness is none other than the Creator and Lord of all, manifested in human form. As Lord of glorious power, He is able to furnish us for every good work and to fortify us by His grace against every evil. The ground of our hope is Christ in the Word, but the evidence of our hope is Christ in the heart working mightily by His Holy Spirit. 
Col 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Godhead incarnate in Christ. Danger of those who would entice away from Christ. Philosophy and legality, mysticism and asceticism. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Complete in Him, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 3, 9. Christ is the wisdom of God, and is of God made wisdom to the humble. The treasures of wisdom are not hidden from us in Christ, but for us. Supposed supplies of spiritual wisdom from any other source are a delusion. The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, not figuratively, but literally, for He is both God and man, the manifestation of the Father to us. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Believers who understand the perfections of Christ and have a well settled judgment of the great truths of the Gospel, will be preserved from all the ensnaring insinuations of those who would corrupt the Gospel principles. All true Christians have a salvation complete in Him and need not pin their faith on the opinions of philosophers nor bear the yoke of ceremonial law. Christ alone is the hope of glory and in Him we are complete. 
Col 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Believer's union with Christ here and hereafter, and the fruit of such union. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Union with Christ, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 1, 3. The believer's eternal standing is in Christ. If by regeneration, we were united to Him, we are reckoned as having died when He died, having risen when He ascended, having been seated in  heaven when He was seated, and as yet to appear with Him when He comes  forth in glory. Our true life is therefore hid with Him. It is our part to make our state conform as nearly as possible with our standing.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The true believer is united with Christ in a union which can never be broken and by virtue of that union he is justified, sanctified and yet to be glorified. Since, as to his standing, his true life is hid with Christ in God, it is his business to mind the concerns of that world to which Christ has ascended, making heaven his scope and aim, and manifesting to those about him, his title and qualifications for heaven, by a consistent Christian  life.   
Col 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Consistent Christian living and fellowship of believers. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Paul, Christ, Tychicus, Onesimus, Aristarchus, Marcus, Barnabas, Justus, Epaphras, Luke, Demas, Archippus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fellowship, vv. 7, 10, 11, 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 5, 6. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The friendship and fellowship together of fellow servants in the Lord, is a great refreshment under the sufferings and difficulties in the way. It adds much to the beauty and strength of the Gospel ministry when Christ's servants are loving and condescending towards one another. Let the people of God pray particularly for those over them in the Lord, that God may enable them to speak as they ought to speak and that doors of utterance may be opened. 
1Th 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The model church. Three tenses of the Christian life. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Silvanus, Timothy. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Our Gospel, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 9-10. Past, present and future salvation in Christ is seen here. Note that the hope of Christ's return is made an integral part of the Gospel and Christian faith. If conscious of a lack of steadiness in the life or power in the testimony, make sure you possess these three aspects of salvation. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who have embraced the full Gospel, as proclaimed by the apostles will manifest it by separation from worldly idols, present service to men in the power of the living God, and expectation of the return of the Lord Jesus. Where true faith is, it will work by love and in the patience of the blessed hope. 
1Th 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The model servant and his reward. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Apostolic ministry, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 19-20. At the second coming of Christ, there will be gathered all those won by the preaching of the Gospel. It is the soul-winner's joy that he will, at that time, meet all those he has won to Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is the great comfort of the servants of Christ to have their own conscience and the consciences of others witness for them that they set out with sincere designs and right principles, preached the Word in its fullness and that their witnessing was not in vain in the Lord. Let not the Ambassadors of Christ be daunted that they must often meet opposition and persecution at the preaching of Christ, but continue faithfully knowing that they shall meet the fruit of their labors at the coming of Christ. 
1Th 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The model Christian brotherhood. The sanctification of the believer. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Timothy. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Brotherly love, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Each chapter ends with reference to Christ's second coming. Chap. 1: linked with salvation (v. 10); Chap. 2: linked with service (19-20); Chap. 3: linked with sanctification (13); Chap. 4: linked with  solace (13-18); Chap. 5: linked with separation (23).  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is easy for the servant of Christ to bear afflictions or persecutions, when he finds the good success of his ministry which is the sure result of sowing in love, and the constancy of those who have accepted Christ under their ministry. Let there be the same mutual love between all Christians that, with their teachers in the Lord, they may be established unblameable at the coming of Christ. 
1Th 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The model walk of the believer. The hope of Christ's return. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sanctification, v. 3. Comfort, vv. 13, 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 7, 14-18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 16. The Lord Jesus HIMSELF, not the Holy Spirit, not the destruction of Jerusalem, not the diffusion of Christianity, not the death of the believer this is the blessed hope. He is coming bringing with Him the spirits of those who have died in Him. Their bodies shall be raised and united then with their spirits. At the same time, living believers will be instantly changed and caught up in clouds to be with Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The design of the Gospel is to teach men not only what they should believe, but also how they should live. It is God's will that all His should be holy in heart and pure in body for "He that calleth us is holy." 
1Th 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The model walk for the believer. The day of Jehovah. Exhortations to believers. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Times and seasons, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 8, 9, 10, 16-21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 2. As the thief usually comes in the dead of the night, so the coming of Christ will surprise the ungodly. It is the happy condition, however, of those who believe God's Word, that they live in momentary expectation of His return, and whether times be troublesome or peaceful, they cannot be surprised if He should come. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let Christians live like men who are awake, living in constant expectation of Christ's return, and having all natural desires under Christ's control. Christ's coming will be sudden, overtaking many who are in the midst of their carnal security and jollity, and bringing them destruction from which there will be no escape. 
1Th 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Believer's comfort in persecution. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Silvanus, Timothy. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Comfort, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 8, 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. As the coming of Christ will reveal His wrath and power upon His enemies, so His grace and power will be magnified in the complete salvation of His saints. This is an evidence that the Church will not pass through the Great Tribulation, the time of God's wrath. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The patient suffering of believers for Christ's sake, is a manifest token that they are worthy to be accounted Christians, since they can suffer for Christianity. God will recompense their trouble with rest of heart now, and with abundant reward at Christ's coming, when also He will recompense trouble to those who have troubled His people. 
2Th 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Day of the Lord and the man of sin. Exhortation and instruction. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Holy Spirit, anti-christ, Satan, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Day of Christ, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 7, 8. The word "letteth" is lit. "restraineth" or "hindereth." The Holy Spirit is the restraining influence now in the world. He will hinder the progress of Satan's gospel until the coming of Christ when He, whose present mission is the formation of the Body of Christ will be taken out of the way with the Body. This will leave Satan unrestrained and will precipitate the Great Tribulation period. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The blessed hope of Christ's coming is a doctrine with which believers are to be deeply affected that they might not be moved about with the conflicting and Satanic heresies of the last days, when there will be general religious apostasy and denial of the program of God's Word. Let us not be deceived by the doctrine of any man or by the trend of events, to let loose of the hope of His imminent return. 
2Th 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Paul's encouragements and exhortations to the Thessalonians. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Paul. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Apostolic commands, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 5, 6, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 5. Patient waiting for Christ is to be joined with the love of God. The hope of His return is the great incentive to a busy life and a life of loving deeds to others.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is required of those who have professed Christianity, that they 
1Ti 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Legalism and unsound teaching rebuked. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Timothy, Alexander, Satan, Hymenaeus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vain jangling, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. The errand of Jesus Christ in the world was not to be a great teacher and reformer, but to die as a ransom for sinners of whom there are two classes the sinner who thinks himself righteous (as did Paul before converted) and the sinner who feels himself a sinner. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Witnesses of Christ must not only be charged to preach the true Gospel doctrine but charged to preach no other doctrine, for it needs no improvement, and to add the letter of the law to the doctrines of grace is an impossible mixture, leading to unprofitable jangling. Those answer the end of the law who have a good conscience toward Christ and faith unfeigned. 
1Ti 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Exhortation to prayer. Divine order for the sexes. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Adam, Eve, Timothy. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Prayer, v. 1. Women, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 5-6. A Mediator supposes a controversy. Sin had made a quarrel between God and man. Jesus Christ, a Mediator, undertook to make peace. He gave Himself a ransom voluntarily so that all mankind might partake of the common salvation. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Christians are to be men much given to prayer, and in their prayers having a generous concern for others as well as for themselves. They are to especially desire for those in civil authority that God will turn their hearts and direct them, making use of them for the accomplishing of His purposes. 
1Ti 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Qualifications of elders and deacons. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Elders, deacons, vv. 2, 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 16. The mystery of Godliness is Christ. He was God manifest in the flesh (John 1:14). Being reproached as a sinner, He was raised by the Spirit and so justified. He was attended by and worshipped by angels. He is offered to the Gentiles as Savior and Redeemer. He is believed on by millions. He is exalted in glory. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those having places of authority in the church must be blameless, not lying under any scandal, watchful against Satan, moderate in all their actions, proving their ability to care for God's people by keeping a Godly and well-governed household, holding the truths of the faith in a pure conscience. 
1Ti 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Walk of a good minister of Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Timothy. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Good minister, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 8, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 1-3. Satan is a theologian and makes use of demons in the last days to lead many away into apostasy. Spiritualism clearly presented here. Two prominent points of its doctrine are seen in v. 3. Abstinence from meat is considered a condition of mediumistic power. Spiritual affinities are taught as against marriage. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those are good ministers of Jesus Christ who are diligent to instil into the minds of their hearers the fundamental truths of God's Word, which will prevent their being seduced by false teachers and drawn away into the apostasy of the last days. Let them not study to advance new notions, but ever be faithful in proclaiming those saving truths which they have received of the apostles and Jesus Christ. 
1Ti 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Work of a good minister of Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Timothy, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Ministerial exhortations, v. 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 8, 22. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Ministers of Jesus Christ are reprovers by office, for they are not alone to preach the Word, but correct those who are inconsistent. A difference is to be made in the reproofs according to the age and circumstances of the persons rebuked. Let them know that they are accountable to God and the Lord Jesus Christ how they have observed the duties of their office, and woe to them if they have been partial in their ministrations. 
1Ti 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Work of the minister continued. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Timothy, Pilate. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Man of God, v. 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7, 10, 12, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 16. Jesus Christ only as yet has triumphed over death. Immortality has to do with the body, not the soul. The believer will be given immortality at His coming, being given a body like unto His glorious body. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The minister of Christ is to preach not only the general duties of all, but the duties of particular relations, that believers may live lives that will truly witness for Christ wherever they are. He is to endeavor after Godliness at all times himself, not making his ministry merely a trade, but a calling wherein he is content with what God allots him, fighting the fight of faith and looking for the coming of Christ, when he shall be abundantly rewarded. 
2Ti 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Apostolic greetings and exhortations to Timothy. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Timothy, Eunice, Phygelus, Hermogenes, Onesiphorus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Exhortations, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 8, 9, 10, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. The threefold purpose of Christ's coming is here stated. 1. To abolish death which is the result of sin. 2. To bring to light salvation through His finished work. 3. To illumine the subject of immortality, which believers are to have through Him at His return. If Jesus had not arisen in a glorified body, immortality would not have been brought to light. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The best of Christ's servants need remembrancers, and what they know, it is well to be reminded of by Godly men that their faith may be strengthened. Let them not be afraid of suffering for Christ's sake, or of owning others who are sufferers for His cause, for they are called with a holy calling, as witnesses of God's eternal purposes in Christ, and by adherence to Him in all circumstances, may be assured that He honors His testimony in and through them. 
2Ti 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Walk of a good soldier of Christ in times of apostasy. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Paul, Timothy, David, Hymenaeus, Philetus, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Good soldier, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 8. "Remember Jesus Christ" raised from the dead. This is the great proof of the Christian mission, and confirmation of the truth of the Gospel. Let suffering saints remember this. His incarnation and resurrection, heartily believed, will support the Christian under all testings of the present life. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who have work to do for Christ must stir themselves up as soldiers to do it, and strengthen themselves for it in His power. They must count upon suffering, even unto death, and therefore must carefully train up others in the faith to succeed them who will approve themselves good soldiers. 
2Ti 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Apostasy predicted. The believer's resource, the Scriptures. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Paul, Timothy, Jannes, Jambres, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Apostasy, vv. 1, 5, 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1-5,12,13,16,17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 5. The Gospel of Christ is the power of godliness (Rom. 1:16). Ihe tendency of the apostasy of the last times will be to accept the ethical teachings of Christ, rejecting the doctrine of regeneration by the Spirit of Christ. It is no marvel that those who cling to. Christ, instead of form, will in those days, be the object of bitter persecution, (v. 12). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The last days of the Gospel dispensation will be perilous times, both on account of persecutions without, and corruptions within. These will be times when it will be difficult to keep a good conscience, and the believers recourse, will be the inspired Word of God, which is demonstrated to be the power of God unto salvation, able to furnish him unto al) good works. 
2Ti 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christ's faithful servant and the faithfulness of Christ to His own. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Demas, Timothy, Luke, Mark, Tychicus, Carpus, Alexander, Prisca, Aquila, Onesiphorus, Erastus, Trephines, Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Charge, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3, 4, 8, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 8. "Crown" is a symbol of reward in N. T. Here is a special reward promised to those who love the truth of Christ's second coming and work and long for it. It is a crown the "post-millennarian" will not receive, for He hopes to set up the millennium without the presence of the King. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It concerns the witnesses of Christ seriously to consider the account they must give the Lord Jesus Christ of the trust reposed upon them as His representatives. Against the last days when there shall be widespread rejection of the doctrines of Christ, men grown weary of the plain Gospel and hankering for philosophies, let us faithfully preach the pure Word of God, apart from any merely human fancies, making full proof of our ministry and loving the truth of His return for His own. 
Tit 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Divine order for local churches. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Paul, Titus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Deceivers, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Divine faith rests not on fallible reasonings and opinions of men, but on the infallible Word of God, the truth itself which purifies the heart of the believer. By this mark, judge of new and strange doctrines, and stop the mouths of those who handle the Word of God deceitfully. 
Tit 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Pastoral work of a true minister. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Paul, Titus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sound doctrine, vv. 1, 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 11, 12, 13, 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 11-13. We have in vv. 12, 13, the A B C's of the school of grace. The Gospel of grace teaches us (1) to leave the old life (2) to live the new life (3) to look for that blessed hope, the glorious appearing of Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The ministers of Christ should discharge their duties with faithfulness, being careful to teach only such truths as are emphasized by God's Word, and dividing to each person, according to their age, and condition in life, those special portions of the truth designed for their particular spiritual needs. Let all considerations of the Gospel be ever linked to those foundation truths, the grace of God in our Lord Jesus Christ, the sanctified life through Him and the blessed hope of His return. 
Tit 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Further instructions concerning pastoral work of a true minister. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Paul, Titus, Artemas, Tychicus, Zenas, Apollos. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Remembrancers, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 5, 8. We cannot serve to get saved. Our salvation is based alone on Christ's finished work which cancels guilt, and the regenerating work of the Spirit which washes the fallen nature, (v. 5) While we are not saved by service, we are saved to serve (vv. 8, 14) which is the manifestation of the salvation wrought in us by the Spirit. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The ministers of Christ are the peoples' remembrancers of their duty as children of God. They should urge upon Christians the duty of subjection to the government, the truth of the unmerited favor of God in Christ, and the necessity of maintaining good works for His glory. 
Phm 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Greeting to Philemon. Intercession for Onesimus. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Timothy, Philemon, Apphia, Archippus, Paul, Epaphras, Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Reception (of Christians), v. 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 17, 18. These verses furnish a perfect illustration of the doctrine of "imputation" whereby guilty sinners believing on Christ are received by the Father as identified with the Son, and the sins of the believing one are reckoned to the account of Christ who paid the price on Calvary. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Wise and good ministers of Jesus Christ will have great and tender care of young converts to encourage and hearten them, and get them received into the fellowship of the saints. There is a spiritual brotherhood between all true believers, however distinguished as to their station of life, and we should therefore seek to strengthen and help those who have been newly united to the Christian family. 
Heb 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The great salvation provided through Jesus Christ who is above prophets and better than angels. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Christ's deity, vv. 3, 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 8. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. The person of the Son was the true image and character of the Person of the Father. He is not said to be the "likeness" of God (implying resemblance) but "image," which means that He reveals God. In beholding His power, wisdom and goodness, men were beholding the Father, for He was God manifest in the flesh, having all the perfections of God in Him. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ as God was equal with the Father, but as God-man revealed the Father to men and became the Mediator between God and men. He is appointed heir of all things, sovereign Lord, absolute dispose? and director both of all persons and all things. He is above every other messenger ever sent into the world and has a name preeminent above all heavenly beings. 
Heb 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Warning against neglecting so great a salvation. Earth to be put under Christ. Jesus temporarily lower than angels to work out salvation for man. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Satan, Abraham. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Great salvation, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 17, 18. Christ became man that He might die, for as God He could not die, therefore He assumed another nature and state. To be a perfect Savior of mankind, He must in every way take man's place being proven perfect under all conditions, and then, as the perfect One, bear our sins. Because of His sufferings as a man, He is made a merciful High Priest, in every way qualified to succor His people. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The salvation provided by Jesus Christ is so great a salvation that none can express nor conceive how great it is. It discovers a great Savior who has manifested God to be reconciled to our natures and reconcilable to our persons. He was made, for a time, lower than angels, that He might humble Himself unto death for our sakes. The fullness of the Godhead dwelling in Him, His suffering could make satisfaction for sin and make salvation possible to all. To reject so great a salvation is thereby made the worst of crimes against God. 
Heb 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christ the Son better than Moses the servant. Warning against unbelief.   <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Warning, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1,12,13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. Jesus Christ as Apostle, spoke from God to men: as High Priest of our profession, He is the Head of the Church, upon whose satisfaction and intercession we profess to depend for acceptance with God. It was necessary to remind the Jews who held Moses in such esteem and were bent on mixing law with grace, that Christ as Son of God was above Moses, therefore His Word was final and His sacrifice sufficient. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We owe to Jesus Christ as the principal messenger sent of God to man, the prime minister of the Gospel church, immediate and careful consideration, lest by delay our hearts be hardened and we should be eternally rejected because of unbelief. Turning a deaf ear to His calls and councils is the spring of all other sins, and the cause of final separa-  tion from God.     
Heb 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The better rest for the believer. The perfect work of redemption. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Rest, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 14-16. The believer should encourage himself, by the excellency and finished work of his Great High Priest, to come boldly to the throne of grace which has taken the place of the throne of inexorable justice. Through Christ's sacrifice, a way is instituted by which God may with honor meet poor sinners and treat with them, no earthly priest being necessary. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The privileges by Christ under the Gospel are far greater than those enjoyed under the Mosaic law. The seventh day rest commemorating a finished creation, was but a type of heart-rest which is to be had by covenant relation with Jesus Christ, and which is offered to those who will renounce their own works as a means of salvation and put their entire trust in the finished work of the Great High Priest who has passed into the heavens. 
Heb 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christ, our Great High Priest after the order of Melchisedec. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Aaron, Melchisedec. <br><b>Key Word</b> - High Priest, vv. 1, 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 8, 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 10. Melchisedec was a type of Christ as High Priest, being both a King and a Priest (Gen. 14:18, Zech. 6:12, 13). Melchisedec has no recorded beginning nor end of life, and the very absence of these facts makes him a type of Him who was from eternity. Christ is the Only One in whom universal Kingship and Priesthood may center. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God was pleased to take One from among men, His only begotten Son, who above all others, was qualified to be a High Priest dealing between God and sinful men. By Him, we have approach to God in hope and God may receive us with honor. Let us therefore not attempt to go to God but through Christ, nor expect any favor from God except upon His merits. 
Heb 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Warning against mixture of law and grace. Danger of tasting the Spirit's work in grace and then going back to ceremonies. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, God, Holy Spirit, Abraham, Melchisedec. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Dead works, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 10, 18, 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 4-6. These verses do not apply to backsliders, for it states that there is no restoration possible after having once fallen away. The reference is to Hebrews fully enlightened in the prophecies about Christ, and having seen Him and having been carried along by the evident work  of the Holy Spirit following His resurrection, yet rejecting all this light. For such there was no further conviction, v. 9 shows that this cannot  occur to a true believer, who has "received" not merely "tasted" and is  "sealed by the Spirit," not merely a "partaker" in His illuminating work.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who have advanced to the very threshold of Christ's salvation, even being clearly convicted by the Holy Spirit and fully enlightened in the Word of God as to the way of life, again turning to trust in dead works and ceremonies, put Christ to an open shame and will not be renewed again to repentance by the Holy Spirit. The true believer takes refuge wholly in Christ's finished work, in which he finds a hope sure and steadfast leading him heavenward. 
Heb 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Melchisedec as a type of Christ. Comparison of. Melchisedec and Aaronic priesthoods. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Melchisedec, Abraham, Levi, Aaron, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Better priesthood, vv. 17, 22. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 19, 24, 25, 26, 27. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 26. No priest could be suitable or sufficient for our reconciliation to God, but One who could meet the conditions hero laid down, and our Lord Jesus alone could meet them. He was free from all habits or principles of sin, never did the least wrong to God or man, was absolutely undefiled in His own life, and was never accessory to other man's sins. Those who come to God by Him are saved, not only PROM the uttermost, but TO the uttermost, (v. 25). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ, the true King-Priest, the anti-type of Melchisedec is greater than all the priests of the order of Aaron, and is the mediator of all blessings to the children of men. Whereas the Levitical priesthood fcould bring nothing to perfection, nor justify men from guilt, Christ's priesthood brings with it a better hope a foundation of salvation and perfect security in Him as Intercessor in heaven. 
Heb 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Aaronic priests a shadow of Christ who mediates a better covenant. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Better covenant, vv. 6, 13. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 4. There are no earthly successors to the priestly tribe of Aaron, for the reason that it is now a heavenly office centered in Jesus Christ. The earthly priesthood is out of commission, for with the atoning death of Christ the vail was rent. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - We have in our Lord Jesus Christ such a High Priest as no other people ever had, all others being but types and shadows of Him. He is the author of a new covenant, better than the old, which was not efficacious; established on better promises; obedience to it springing from a willing heart and mind rather than from fear; securing the personal revelation of the Lord to every believer and guaranteeing the complete oblivion of sins through His finished work. 
Heb 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Ordinances and sanctuary of the old covenant as types of the new. The realities of the new covenant which is sealed by the blood of Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Aaron, High Priest, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Atonement, v. 22. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11, 12, 15, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 24-28. We have here three great aspects of the work of Christ, v. 26 atonement the past tense of His work for our salvation, v. 24 advocacy the present tense of His work for us. v. 28. advent when He will return to complete our salvation from the very presence of sin. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Christ is a more excellent High Priest than any under the law, who but prefigured the work He came to do. He has entered once for all within the Holiest place. Having undertaken to be our High Priest He could not have been admitted into heaven without shedding His blood for us, having no errors of His own to offer for, and neither can any of us enter God's glorious presence except by a saving trust in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus, without which remission for sins is impossible. 
Heb 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Law only a shadow of things to come. Through Christ a way made into the Holiest for all believers. Warning to the Hebrews who were wavering between Jewish sacrifices and Christ's finished work. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Moses. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Better sacrifice, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19-25, 29, 31, 37. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 26-29. In v. 26, "more sacrifice" should be "other sacrifice." If this "judgment and fiery indignation" were the penalty of every sin, what Christian could escape for there is none who has not since converted given way to sin by consent of the will. These verses must be taken with the context, which contrasts the inefficacious and oft-repeated sacrifices of the law with the one sacrifice of Christ. There were many Hebrews perfectly enlightened, having witnessed the works of Christ and the Holy Spirit, but who deliberately put themselves under the law, trusting to "other sacrifices," thereby treading under foot the blood of Christ. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The legal sacrifices under the law, which were but shadows of Christ's atonement, could never make the comers perfect nor satisfy justice. Now, under the Gospel, Christ's atonement is perfect and not to be repeated, and the sinner once pardoned, is ever pardoned as to his standing, and only needs to walk in communion with God, on the basis of Christ's blood, to have a continuous sense of God's pardon and favor. 
Heb 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Superiority of the way of faith. Instances of faith. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Abel, Cain, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sara, Joseph, Moses, Pharaoh's daughter, Rahab, Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthae, David, Samuel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Faith, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 6. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 2, 39. The effect of faith with God is "good reputation." Is it any wonder that God cannot be pleased when men are devoid of that trust in His Word and in Jesus Christ whom He has sent, which receives Him as Savior and Lord and impels to obedience and good works? <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Faith is the firm persuasion that God will perform all that He has promised to us in Christ, and brings the soul a present fruition and foretaste of eternal things, which sets a seal that God is true. The way of faith is the way of victory, peace, assurance, and endurance. 
Heb 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The Father's chastening of believers and its purpose. The difference between living under law and under grace. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Esau, Moses, Abel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Chastening, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 5, 6, 14, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 1, 2. Christ is not only the object, but the Author of our faith. He is the purchaser of the Spirit of faith and the publisher of the rule 'of faith and the cause of the grace of faith. He is also the finisher of our faith the fulfilling of all Scripture promises and prophecies, the finisher of grace, the rewarder of faith and will eventually bring faith to an end by bringing us to Himself. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Christians have a race to run, of service and sufferings, a course of active and passive obedience, in all of which they need to keep their eyes fixed upon the Lord Jesus. The best of God's children may need chastisement, but afflictions rightly endured, though they be the fruits of God's displeasure are yet proofs of His paternal'love and designed to fit us better for His service and to bring us closer into His fellowship. 
Heb 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Exhortations to the Christian. Separation and worship. Apostolic <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Timothy. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Instructions. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 5, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 12, 13. Our Lord Jesus was the perfect anti-type of the sin offering, being offered "without the gate," a striking illustration of His humiliation as a sin bearer. The believer is therefore exhorted to go forth from the ceremonial law, from sin, from the world, and identify himself with Christ, being willing to bear His reproach in gratitude for the salvation He has provided. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Our Lord Jesus purchased us with His blood that He might set us apart a peculiar people zealous of good works. Let us therefore seek to excel in those duties becoming to Christians, such as brotherly love, generosity, contentment, obedience to those over us, fixedness in the faith, patient suffering with Him and continual praise.  
Jam 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Testing of faith. Solicitation to evil not of God. Obedience as a test of true faith. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, James. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Tests of faith, vv. 3, 8, 12, 22, 26. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 17, 22, 25, 27. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Such as have a true title in Jesus Christ through faith may expect to be called upon to endure many tests of faith, but the -genuineness of their calling will be manifest by their stability in trial, their fidelity to God and the principles of Christianity, their activity in good works and the co.ntrol of the carnal nature at all times. God is the source of wisdom and power continually. 
Jam 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The tests of brotherly love and good words. Justification before men by our works. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, James, Abraham, Isaac, Rahab. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Brotherly love, v. 8. Works, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 8, 10, 14, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - There is perfect harmony between James and Paul on justification. Paul is considering man in relation to God, in which he is "justified by faith apart from works." James is considering man in relation to his fellowman, in which case works are the visible evidence of faith. We have a right to believe that a profession of faith which bears no fruit, is an empty profession. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Those who are possessors of Christ's salvation, which the poorest Christian may partake of equally with the rich, and to which all earthly glory is but vanity, should not make men's outward advantages the measure of their respect, but should love all, rich or poor, as themselves. 
Jam 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Control of the tongue. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, James. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Tongue, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 6, 10, 17. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Christian who is not affected by the sins of the tongue but takes care to avoid them, has an undoubted sign of true grace. The wisdom and grace of God which enables one to control the tongue, will enable him also to control all other actions. 
Jam 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Rebuke of worldliness and exhortation to humility before God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Lusts, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Worldly and fleshly lusts are the distemper which will not allow contentment or satisfaction in the mind, and rise up to the exclusion of prayer and the working of our affections toward God. Let the Christian be free from the friendship of the world, and be submitted to God, thus shutting and bolting the door against the devil. 
Jam 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Warning to the rich. Exhortations in view of Christ's second coming. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Job, Elias, James. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Last days, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 8, 10, 16, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 7, 8. Here we see Christ's waiting for the precious fruit of the earth, the gathering in of the elect. In 2 Thess. 3:5 we have the saint's waiting for Him. The hope of His coming is the only solution of the complicated problems that will arise in the last days between capital and labor, (vv. 1-6.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Great amassing of wealth will be a sign of the last days, but woe to those who then heap together treasure for themselves, for when Christ comes that in which they have placed their hopes will bring them eternal misery. Regardless of the prosperity of the wicked, or the affliction of the righteous, the blessed hope of Christ's return will keep the believer steady and patient. Let this therefore incite him to all the duties of the Gospel, and especially to patience and prayer. 
1Pe 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christian's conduct under suffering in the light of full salvation. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Peter. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Living hope, vv. 3, 5, 7, 13, 25. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 15, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25.<br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 18, 19. The blood of Christ is precious because it redeems (v. 19). Brings us nigh to God (Eph. 2:13). Blots out our sins (Rev. 1:5). Brings peace (Col. 1:20). (Justifies) (Rom. 5:9). Cleanses (1 John 1:7). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The true Christian's hope of eternal life and a glorious inheritance through the precious sacrifice and resurrection of Christ, is a hope that quickens him to service, supports him in every trial of faith and conducts him in a way of holiness to heaven. 
1Pe 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Exhortation to holiness and growth in view of Christ's great sacrifice. Christ's vicarious sufferings. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Peter. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Growth, vv. 2, 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 5, 9, 11, 15, 19, 20, 21, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 8. Christ crucified is the Rock. To the church He is the foundation and chief corner stone (Eph. 2:20). To the Jews, at His first advent, a stumbling stone (Rom. 9:32, 33; 1 Cor. 1:23). To Israel at His second advent he will be made headstone of the corner (Zech. 6:7). To the Gentile world powers at His second coming, He will become the smiting stone (Dan. 2:34). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Word of God is the proper and necessary food for the soul, which, if rightly used, does not leave a man as it finds him, but improves him, causing him to realize his spiritual position in the world, the duty of patient and Christlike submission, and the necessity of purging out those things from the life which are contrary to Christ. 
1Pe 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Duties of husbands and wives toward one another. Exhortations to Christian consistency. Christ's vicarious sacrifice. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Sara, Abraham. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Good conversation, v. 16. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 18-20. The word "preached" is lit. "Heralded." Christ's spirit at His death heralded the triumph of the cross in the spirit world. There is no indication of any chance for repentance either of angel or man. The saved spirits who awaited Him in Paradise, upon the announcement of the finished work of the cross went with Him above, whence He then removed Paradise, and they will appear with Him at His second advent to receive their glorified bodies.   <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Worldly men are strict observers of the manner of life of the professors of religion. A chaste conversation with Christian respect in the home life and careful Christian conduct toward all, following the Lord Jesus especially in His example of suffering for righteousness sake, is an excellent means to win men to the faith of the Gospel. 
1Pe 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Exhortations to mortification of sin and living unto God. Suffering with Christ. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Godly living, vv. 2, 7, 19. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. Some of the strongest arguments against sin are taken from the suffering of Christ. He died to destroy sin, and having submitted to such sufferings on account of sin, why should we grieve Him by continuing in sin? All sympathy with Christ is lost if we do not put away sin. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Christ having suffered so much for us, should cause us to fortify ourselves with His mind, courage and resolution, living no longer to the flesh but being conformed to the holy will of God, as those who must give account any day at His appearing. We should rejoice to suffer with Christ for righteousness' sake, knowing that if we are in His hands our suffering will promote the Gospel and prepare us for glory. 
1Pe 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christian service in view of Christ's soon coming. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Peter, Satan, Silvanus, Marcus. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Humility, v. 5, vigilance, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 6, 7, 8, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 6. The best definition of humility is found in John 13:4, 5. Our Lord Jesus was the perfect embodiment of humility. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Humility is a great preserver "of peace and order in the church, giving to Christ's ministers a proper attitude toward the flock and to His people a proper submission to their leaders in the Lord. There is mutual opposition between God and the proud, but he who is humble before God will find grace for every trial and power to meet every assault of the devil. 
2Pe 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The great Christian virtues. God's Word exalted. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Peter. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fruitful life, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 19, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 16. The plan of salvation by Jesus Christ is eminently the council of the infinitely wise Jehovah, for certainly man could not have invented it. He is the Messiah promised by the prophecies and publicly owned by the Father from the opened heavens. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Christian should be diligent to add one Christian grace to another that he may bring glory to God by abounding in much fruit among men and that his own calling and election may be thereby thoroughly tested out. He should the more seek to obey God's Word because it is God-inspired, of undoubted truth, and therefore of vast concern. 
2Pe 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Warnings concerning apostate teachers. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Noah, Lot, Balaam. <br><b>Key Word</b> - False teachers, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. Smooth-tongued false teachers seldom deny Jesus Christ "who TAUGHT" but they do deny Jesus "who BOUGHT." The devil hates the doctrine of the CROSS of Christ, and hence all the conflicting theories as to His death. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Where God sends His true messengers with His Word, the devil always sends some to seduce and deceive, and especially to deny Christ's redemptive work. Such men bring swift destruction upon themselves, even though they prosper for a while. 
2Pe 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Return of the Lord and the Day of Jehovah. Christ's return to be generally denied. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Peter. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Day of the Lord, v. 10. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. Men may talk about the stability of natural laws and the foolishness of the doctrine of Christ's second coming, but the Christian faith signifies little without it. It is the finishing stroke which must complete all the great doctrines of the Gospel and is therefore a day for which the Christian is to look (v. 12) and strive to hasten, by the bringing in of souls for the completion of the church. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The general denial that will be made in the last days of the possibility of Christ's return, should not unsettle the believer, but quicken and excite him to a serious minded and firm adhering to what God has revealed in His Word. Those who now scoff will find the day of Christ's coming a day of terrible vengeance. 
1Jo 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Fellowship with God made possible through the incarnation. Conditions of perpetual fellowship walking in the light and confessing sins. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, John. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fellowship, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 9. Our sins were judicially dealt with at the cross (1 Pet. 2:24) which results in eternal life, but unconfessed and unforsaken sin in the believer brings the loss of fellowship with God and chastisement. (1 Cor. 11:31-33) Confession of sin would not bring fellowship with God, unless the sinner had accepted the finished work of Christ on the cross. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Fellowship with the Father, which has been made possible through the incarnation of Christ, the eternal Word, can be maintained only by walking in the light, which signifies the recognizing of our sins with frank confession of them and forsaking of them as they are revealed to us, and belief in Christ crucified as the remedy for sin. 
1Jo 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christ's advocacy for the believer. Tests of fellowship, obedience and love. Warning against worldliness and apostates. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, John, Satan, anti-christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Knowing Him, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 6, 15, 17, 22, 23. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 1. Even the most advanced believers have their sins, but there is a distinction between them and the sinners of the world, for the former have an Advocate in heaven. As they have had Christ's blood applied to them upon their acceptance of Him, so they have an Advocate to procure their continued forgiveness as they confess their sins. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - To know God and the power of His love is impossible without practical observance of His Word, which means that we must seek to walk as Christ walked, in love toward our fellowmen and in separation from the things of the world. To profess to know God and yet deny Jesus as the Christ is to brand oneself as given up to the delusions of the devil. 
1Jo 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - God's love magnified and the believer exhorted to holiness. Brotherly love urged. How our hearts may be assured before God. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Satan, Cain, John. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Purity, v. 3. Love, v. 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 2-3. The time of the revelation of the sons of God in their proper state and in bodies like unto His glorious body, awaits the second coming of Christ. This is the purifying hope of the church which  engages all believers to the prosecution of holy living that they might be in readiness to meet Him unashamed at His coming.  <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It is a wonderful and condescending love of the Father that we, who by nature are heirs of sin, guilt and the curse, should be called the sons of God and given such hopes in Christ. It is a contradiction to such love and hope to live in sin and impurity. Purity, love and a clear conscience toward God are marks of our transition into this state of life. 
1Jo 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Christians warned of false doctrines concerning Christ's person and work. Tests of the true. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, anti-christ, John. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Truth and error, v. 6. Love, v. 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 19, 20. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Seven tests of true doctrine are given here. Does it confess Christ's true humanity? vv. 9, 15. His vicarious atonement? vv. 10, 14. Does it tend to worldliness? vv. 4, 5. Do spiritually minded people agree with it? v. 6. Does it witness to the spirit of divine love? vv. 7, 8. Does it accord with the teaching of the Holy Spirit? v. 13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - God's people must be ever cautious concerning false teachers that may arise to deny the incarnation, deity and atonement of the Lord Jesus, and must accept none of their claims without testing them by God's Truth in the light of the Holy Spirit's teaching. The spirit of truth is known not only by doctrine but by love which is the natural fruit of the Spirit. The manifestation of divine love through the life argues a true and just apprehension of the divine nature, and such love can never deny the Lord Jesus. 
1Jo 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Faith the overcoming principle. The advantages of faith in salvation, prayer, preservation from sin. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Satan, John. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Overcoming faith, v. 4. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 6. Jesus in His death had a double purpose, not only to save us from hell but to cleanse us. We are denied inwardly by the pollution of sin. Through Him we have "the washing of regeneration." We are denied outwardly by the guilt of sin, and by His blood we are separated from sin's condemnation. (Heb. 9:22. See Jn. 19:34-35.) <br><b>Conclusion</b> - He who has been born again through Jesus Christ will manifest the effect of regeneration, which is a spiritual conquest of the world. Faith is the means, the instrument and spiritual armor and artillery by which the believer may overcome the world, Satan and sin, and ask and receive of God all that is needful in this life. 
2Jo 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Truth and love inseparable in the Christian life. Doctrine the test of reality. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, John, elect lady, anti-christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Truth and love, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6, 9, 10. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 9. The most important doctrine in the Word is the doctrine concerning the person and work of Jesus Christ. If one is unsound in this, they are bound to be wrong everywhere. All turns on "what think ye of Christ?" He that denieth the Son hath not the Father. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The test of our love to God is universal obedience to Him, and we have need to maintain this love, for there are many destroyers of it in the world those who subvert the faith, denying the person or the work of Jesus Christ. Let such men not be entertained as ministers of Christ, nor given support in any way. 
3Jo 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Exhortation concerning ministering brethren. The domineering Diotrephes and the good Demetrius. <br><b>Characters</b> - John, Gaius, Diotrephes, Demetrius. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Fellow helpers, v. 8. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 11. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Ministers of Christ should abound in, and joy in hospitality toward fellow helpers in the Lord, and should beware of the peril of a domineering leadership which stands in the way of blessing to the people of God. 
Jud 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The apostasy and apostate teachers described. Assurance and comfort for true believers. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Jude, James, Michael, Moses, Cain, Balaam, Enoch, Adam. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Apostasy, vv. 4, 18. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3(b), 21, 24, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 21. We can be kept in the perpetual consciousness of God's love only as we depend upon the mercy of the Lord Jesus that is His mercy, not our merit being our constant plea. He has merited for us what we could never, otherwise, lay claim to. The only way to stand before Him flawless is to rest in His merits and walk in His love. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Believers must be on their guard lest they be robbed of any essential article of Christian faith by the cunning craftiness or plausible pretenses of ungodly men who pose as teachers and lie in wait to deceive. Our duty in the presence of the apostasy is to earnestly contend for the faith, trusting to be kept from stumbling by walking in the perpetual consciousness of God's love through Christ, looking toward the day when we shall be presented before Him with exceeding joy. 
Rev 1:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The Patmos vision of John and the command to write. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, John. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Revelation, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 5, 6, 7, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - This book is the only book having the Lord Jesus Himself as Author (v. 1). It is a "revelation," which means "an unveiling" or "disclosure," not a mystery, and the Lord Jesus has attached His benediction to it to encourage us to read, hear and keep (v. 3). Notice in v. 5 that He Who speaks from heaven is He Who "washed us from our sins in His own blood." Heaven's anthem magnifies the blood of Christ above everything else. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Jesus Christ, the Alpha and the Omega, speaks to believers through the Apostle John concerning things past, the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter. Blessed are they who make this Book their meditation and regard those things which are written therein, for they shall shortly come to pass. 
Rev 2:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message to Ephesus concerning things "which are." Their first love left. Message to Pergamos concerning false doctrines. Message to Smyrna concerning persecutions. Message to Thyatira concerning Balaamism and Nicolaitanism. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Messengers of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, and Thyratira, John, Satan, Antipas, Balaam, Balac, Jezebel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Messages to Churches (Overcoming), vv. 7, 11, 17, 26. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 7, 10, 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The letters to the Churches are Epistles of Christ dictated before the throne (v. 1) and with holy awe we should therefore read, then  obey them. While these letters deal with Churches existing in John's time, it is believed that they are also symbolical of seven stages of the  Church during the present Church age, because Jesus speaks of the "mystery" connected with them; because of the number "seven" connected with  them, and always symbolical in this book; because the promises and warnings are continuous and because the prophetic view corresponds exactly  with events thus far in the history of the Church.    <br><b>Conclusion</b> - He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Holy Spirit would say to the Church, and let him beware lest by turning a deaf ear to the voice of the Spirit he lose his faculty of spiritual hearing and thus grow cold toward Christ, be without victory in tribulations or find himself an apostate carried away by every wind of doctrine. Those are bound to be overcomers under every test whose faith keeps them in vital touch with Jesus Christ, the Head of the Church (1 Jno. 4:4). 
Rev 3:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Message to Sardis concerning their hypocrisy. Message to Philadelphia on hollow profession. Message to Laodicea on apostasy. Christ's attitude to the Church in its final stage in the world. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Messengers of Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, David, John, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Message to Church (overcoming), vv. 5, 12, 21. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 18, 20, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 20. Supper is the evening meal, the last taken before the morning breaks and the day dawns. This verse is a picture of Christ seeking entrance to the Church of the final state, and calling for individuals out of it who will sup with Him. "The night is far spent; the day is at hand." To sup with Him before the morning breaks is the foretaste of coming glory. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Let the believer keep his spiritual ears open continually, for the voice of the Holy Spirit, lest he be found merely professing the name of Christian, and not having the power thereof, or lest he grow lukewarm toward Christ, and so be taken unawares, or even found to be a counterfeit at the sudden appearing of Christ in glory. 
Rev 4:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Things which shall be. Vision of the throne in heaven, the enthroned elders, the four living creatures and their worship with the elders because of creation. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, Holy Spirit, John, 24 elders. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Things coming to pass, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Christ is not seen here upon the throne, but as having risen for the execution of other purposes which effect the establishment of His Messianic Kingdom. Heaven is preparing to execute judgment prior to Christ's coming with His saints to reign. The elders are seen identified with Him in the judgment about to be executed. May they not be the united royal priesthood, redeemed and glorified? The answer as to how they got there is not given here, but will be found answered as we proceed. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The day is approaching when there shall be a shifting of scenes in heaven and God shall prepare to execute all His purposes toward the earth. Thundering black clouds shall gather for His last judgment upon the earth, but even in the darkness of that day a bow in the cloud will be seen reflecting the glory of God in the storm and reminding that God has not forgotten His covenants. In that day the saints in heaven will contrast the perfect rest of heaven with the troubled waters of earth and will give great glory to Him. 
Rev 5:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the seven sealed books. Christ seen in His Kingly character. Angels, elders and living creatures exalt the Lamb who is King. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, John, strong angel, elders, four creatures. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Sealed book, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The Lion and the Lamb are One (v. 5). The sacrifice of the Lamb made Him the Saviour of the redeemed, but He is yet to assume power as the Lion, for the execution of judgment when His purpose in the Church is perfected. Notice in v. 9 that it is the blood that the saints are still singing about. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It will be none other than the Lord Jesus Christ, Who as the Lamb of God was slain and rejected of men, Who will yet be manifested as the Lion of the tribe of Judah breaking the seals of God's wrath against sinners upon the earth. He Who alone was worthy to redeem mankind with His precious blood, is worthy to take man's judgment in hand. Happy are they who shall in that day be with the ransomed ones in heaven joining in the new song, associating with Him in judgment and preparing to reign with Him. 
Rev 6:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The opening of the seals. Characters: Christ, John. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, John. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Day of wrath, v. 17. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15-17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 16-17. This will be the last great prayer meeting of earth, when men that have rejected Christ shall discover that the Lamb Whom they have slaughtered and insulted is the Judge of all. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Woe to those who dwell upon the earth in the days of the great Tribulation, when the wrath of God is poured forth for the final cleansing of the earth. "Except those days should be shortened no flesh should endure." There will be terrible wars, famines, pestilence, earthquakes, disturbances in the heavens, and fear among men. (See Mt. 24:1-31.) 
Rev 7:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - A parenthetical chapter on the saved of the tribulation period. The remnant of Israel sealed. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, John, -four angels. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Remnant sealed, vv. 3, 13, 14. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10, 14, 17. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 10. 14. The cry of these who come up out of the Great Tribulation is not the same as the cry of redemption (5:9). It is the cry of salvation from judgment. While it is the blood of Christ which has purchased them this release, yet they are not members of the Body of Christ, the Church which is to be completed by the Holy Spirit before the Tribulation begins. They are a separate company. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In the great time of unexampled trouble which is to fall upon the earth after the translation of the saints, there shall be a vast company of repentant Israelites sealed for preservation, and a multitude of the Gentiles, moved to repentance toward Christ, shall find salvation through His shed blood, but at the cost of martyrdom (v. 14. See 6:9-11). 
Rev 8:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Opening of the seventh seal from which seven trumpets come. Four of the trumpet judgments announced. <br><b>Characters</b> - John, seven angels, angel with censor. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Trumpet judgments, v. 6. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Woe to those who, by their rejection of the Lord Jesus, will find themselves left upon the earth to taste the sufferings of the Great Tribulation. Satanic forces will be allowed abroad without restraint, bringing fear upon all men by reason of conditions in the earth and in the heavens above. 
Rev 9:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Judgments of the fifth and sixth trumpets. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, angels, John, Abaddon. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Trumpet woes, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 6. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - So fearful and unbearable will conditions be in the Great Tribulation days when Satanic powers are unrestrained, that men shall long for death and even try to commit suicide, but will find the power of selfdestruction taken away from them. Happy are they who shall escape all these things, that shall come to pass, through true faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Rev 10:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parenthetical explanation (to 11:14). The angel and the little book. The book eaten. <br><b>Characters</b> - John, mighty angel. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Little book, v. 2. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The day is approaching when all those mysterious judgment pictures of God's Word shall be made real in action (v. 7). Apocalyptic studies are understood by those who walk in close fellowship with God and while they have their charm, to the true man of God, they have also their bitterness when really appropriated, by reason of the startling and terrible prospective they reveal (v. 9). 
Rev 11:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Times of the Gentiles to end in a period of forty-two months. Two heavenly witnesses will prophecy on the earth. The seventh trumpet judgment. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Holy Spirit, Christ, John, two witnesses, beast, elders. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Tribulation, witnesses, v. 3. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 15, 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 3, 15. As the days of Christ's reign approach there will be increased announcement of the apocalyptic truths which will be scoffed at by the majority. (2 Pet. 3:3-4) The final announcement will be made in the midst of the great Tribulation by heaven-prepared witnesses, as His first advent was announced by John the Baptist. With this testimony rejected and the witnesses killed, men will be abandoned to the terrible days of the last half of the Tribulation, after which Christ will come to reign forever. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Tribulation days which close the times of the Gentiles shall culminate in a period of intense troubles lasting 42 months (3% years). When these days shall come, God will send two messengers to earth to give warning. They will be despitefully treated and killed as was our Lord and the prophets before Him. Woe to those who shall see these days, but happy those who through Jesus Christ are safe with Him and engaged eternally in His praises. 
Rev 12:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The woman clothed with the sun (Israel). Satan drawing the stars. The man-child (Christ) caught up to the throne. The arch-angel and his angels fighting Satan. Satan and Israel in the great Tribulation. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Michael, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Satan's wrath, v. 12. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 9, 10, 11. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 9-10. In the midst of the great Tribulation, Satan will be cast out of the heavenlies and will be free in the earth. This will be a happy time for those who are in heaven by the blood of the Lamb, but a time of terrible trial for Israel and eternal woe for the Gentiles who submit to the mark of the beast. The only salvation in those days will be bold confession of faith in the blood of the Lamb, which will mean martyrdom to all except those sealed for physical preservation. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - Israel out of which came the Messiah Who was rejected, will in the midst of the great Tribulation suffer terrible anguish because of Him, and will be subjected to terrors of Satan himself, who will then be unrestrained and knowing that he has but a short time. However, those whom God shall seal of Israel will be brought through those terrible days, though many will suffer martyrdom, but they will then die willingly for Him, acknowledging Him their King, their sacrifice and their Lord. 
Rev 13:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The beast out of the sea and the beast out of the earth. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, John, false prophet, anti-christ, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Two beasts, vv. 1, 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 18. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 8. Salvation in the great Tribulation is still based on the blood of Jesus Christ. Those who are then saved, however, must boldly confess their faith before a world of hostile witnesses, which will mean nothing short of martyrdom, except to those few sealed in Israel. May God help every reader of these words to make sure their calling and election while the days of grace are still lasting! <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In the midst of the Tribulation period there shall rise up two great world leaders, one a political leader inspired by Satan himself, the other a religious leader to deceive the people with strong delusions and either lead them or force them to worship the anti-christ as the long expected world-ruler. These two Satanic deceivers shall prevail upon all except those who risk all to boldly acknowledge their belief in the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world. 
Rev 14:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the Lamb and the 144,000 sealed Israelites. The angel with the everlasting gospel. Fall of Babylon. The doom of the beast worshippers. Blessedness of the holy dead. Vision of Armageddon. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, John, angels, anti-christ. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Tribulation saints and sinners, vv. 1,9. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 13. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 14-15. He who bears the golden crown is none other than the Lord Jesus, who will a short time after this be found wearing the crown of universal sovereignty (Rev. 19:12). At the close of the great Tribulation He will thrust in the sickle to cut down the earth's harvest of evil (this will be at Armageddon) which will then have come to its culmination (see Mk. 4:29). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There shall be preserved during the great Tribulation period a great company out of Israel, who will follow the Lamb and give glory to Him at whatever cost. There will be also a multitude of Gentiles redeemed by their acceptance of the everlasting Gospel, but at the cost of martyrdom. Woe to those who worship the beast and receive his mark, for they shall be tormented in hell forever. 
Rev 15:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vision of the angels of the seven last plagues and the bowls of the wrath of God. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, John, 7 angels, Moses, 4 beasts. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Wrath of God, vv. 1, 7. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 3. "King of saints" is literally "King of ages, or nations." Jesus is never represented as King of the saints, or the Church, but as their Lord. The relationship of the Church saints in the present age is a nearer relationship than that of subjects of a King. He is the Bridegroom. These Tribulation saints, however, will be related to Him as subjects and they exalt Him as "King of Nations." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - In the hours when the unexampled wrath of God is being poured out upon the earth there will be a faithful redeemed company, who in spite of all their sufferings for Christ's sake, will be enabled to join in the great chorus exalting Jehovah their Deliverer and the Lamb, their Saviour. 
Rev 16:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Vials of God's wrath poured out. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, John, 7 angels, beast, 3 demons. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Vials of wrath, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 6, 15. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - v. 15. Even in the great Tribulation there is an advent hope held out to keep the remnant looking up. Before Christ's first advent believers in the promises were inspired and kept by the expectation of His coming. Until the rapture of the Church, His second coming is held out as the "blessed hope." In the great Tribulation, the one and only hope of relief will be His return in glory with the saints to cleanse the earth and to reign. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There shall, in the great Tribulation period, be poured out such manifestations of the wrath of God against Satan and sinners as man has never conceived. The terrors of those days will surpass anything known in the earth before those days, and shall never be known thereafter. Woe to those who choose, by their rejection of Christ in the Gospel day, to be left to that time. 
Rev 17:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The doom of Babylon, the last great ecclesiastical order. <br><b>Characters</b> - Christ, John, 7 angels, beast. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Mystery Babylon, v. 5. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 14. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - Many Bible students believe that we have here the Roman Catholic system headed up in a fearfully apostate state. A woman is symbolical of "church" (2 Cor. 11:12). This woman (v. 5) stands in contrast to the Church of Christ, which is a "chaste virgin." The true Church is "espoused to one husband;" this one is given up to the kings of the earth. The Church is the "mystery of godliness;" this one is "mystery Babylon." The Church offers "the cup of Salvation;" this one offers "cup full of abominations." Mystery Babylon is rich, and it has its seat on seven hills (Rome). <br><b>Conclusion</b> - There will be in the Tribulation period a great apostate ecclesiastical system headed up under a powerful religious leader, drawing after it thousands of deluded worshippers, who in reality are worshipping the devil and the beast. This enormous world-system will be brought to a fearful end and all those connected with it will share its fate. 
Rev 18:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Last form of apostate Christendom and the warning to God's people. The human and the angelic views of Babylon. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, John, angels. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Babylon's fall, vv. 2, 21. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - As there is to be an ecclesiastical Babylon ("confusion") heading up in the great Tribulation period, so there is also a great political Babylon, the pride of the great men of the earth, which shall likewise come to a terrible and an everlasting end, when Christ shall return in glory. This great system, back of which is anti-christ, will bitterly hate any who would glorify any god but materialism and the beast and will be guilty of the blood of many prophets and saints who have stood true to the everlasting Gospel. 
Rev 19:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Parenthetical chapter on what is taking place in heaven while the Tribulation rages. The alleluias, marriage of the Lamb, second coming in glory, Armageddon, doom of the beast, False Prophet, and kings. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, John, 24 elders, 4 beasts, angel, beast, False Prophet. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Marriage supper, v. 9. Armageddon, v. 15. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 5, 7, 8, 9. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 11-16. We have here a vision of the departure from heaven of Christ with His saints (previously caught up to be with Him 1 Thes. 4:13-18) and with His angels preparatory to the catastrophe in which all world powers shall be smitten (Dan. 2:34-35). On Christ's head here we see many crowns ("diadems") (cf. 14:14) for the hour is now at hand when He is to be exalted and enthroned in His Kingdom, to "sit upon the throne of His father David." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - During those days when the wrath of God is poured out upon the earth, the Bride of Christ will in heaven celebrate the long looked for marriage festivities, and arrayed in her cleansed garments shall be eternally united with Him Who is to be recognized in all the universe, and for all time, as King of King and Lord of Lords. When He comes forth to make an end of all evil, His Bride shall come with Him, associated in judgment, and later to rule with Him. 
Rev 20:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - Satan bound for the Kingdom age. The first resurrection. Satan loosed at the end of the millenium, and his final doom. Judgment of the great White Throne. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, John, angel, Satan. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Judgment, vv. 2, 11. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 4, 6, 12. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 4, 6. Christ is seen in this chapter as the Judge and then as the millenial King. Those who are associated with Him in this Kingdom are the Church and the Tribulation saints. Those who are now being called unto Christ are therefore appointed, not to be subjects of the Kingdom, but co-rulers, priests of God and of Christ, and will have their specific work in connection with the work of His universal empire. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - When the Tribulation days shall have run their course, Christ shall come with His saints, and having cast down all opposing powers, will fling Satan into the bottomless pit for a thousand years, during which time He, with the saints, shall rule over the earth. At the end of the millenium Satan will be temporarily released, but he and his quickly gathered followers will be cast into the final hell forever. At that time also the unsaved dead of all the ages will be resurrected and after being judged according to their works will be given their portion in perdition. 
Rev 21:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The seven new things of the Kingdom age earth, peoples, Jerusalem, temple, light, Paradise (Chap. 22). <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, John, 7 angels. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Heaven, v. 1. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 2, 4, 6, 7, 23, 24, 25. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - vv. 9, 23. The peculiar glory of the Lord Jesus to all eternity is as the "Lamb" which will ever remind of His sacrificial act upon the cross. This title is applied to Him 27 times in Revelation. In the presence of "the Lamb," there will be no need of sun nor moon, any more than here we need to light candles at noon-day, for "the Lamb is the light thereof." <br><b>Conclusion</b> - It will be the perfect happiness of the saints, when Christ returns to reign, to have God's immediate presence with them, His love fully manifested to them and His glory fully put upon them. No remembrance of former sorrows shall remain and all causes for future sorrow shall be removed. Whatever is excellent and valuable in this world will be there enjoyed to a far greater degree, and Christ will be the everlasting fountain of knowledge and joy to His people. 
Rev 22:	<b>footnotes</b><br><b>Contents</b> - The New Paradise and its river of the water of life. The last exhortation of Christ to be ready for His second coming. <br><b>Characters</b> - God, Christ, Holy Spirit, John, angel, David. <br><b>Key Word</b> - Imminent return, vv. 7, 12, 20. <br><b>Key Verses</b> - 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. <br><b>Striking Facts</b> - The Bible closes with emphasis on the fidelity of the Scriptures (v. 6) on salvation by grace the free gift of the Lord Jesus (v. 17) - and on the doctrine of the pre-millennial return of Christ (vv. 7, 12, 20). The great "peace prayer" of the Bible, and the last prayer of the Bible, is "Come, Lord Jesus," and Jesus' last recorded words are, "Surely, I come quickly. Amen." This is the thought He would leave with us. May God open the eyes of every reader to the "blessed hope, the glorious appearing of the Great God and our Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ." Tit. 2:13. <br><b>Conclusion</b> - The Paradise lost by the first Adam shall be restored by the Second Adam, and in this Paradise there shall be multitudes saved through the Lamb, to behold its beauties and to taste its pleasures forever. Let all men labor to understand the prophecies of these things shortly coming to pass that they might be prepared to meet the Lord Jesus, having embraced His salvation, yea, and earnestly longing and praying for the hour of His appearance. "Even so, come, Lord Jesus." <br>
