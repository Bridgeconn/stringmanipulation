# Son of Man, son of man #

## Definition: ##

The title "Son of Man" was used by Jesus to refer to himself. He often used this term instead of saying "I" or "me."

* In the Bible, "son of man" could be a way of referring to or addressing a man. It could also mean "human being."
* Throughout the Old Testament book of Ezekiel, God frequently addressed Ezekiel as "son of man." For example he said, "You, son of man, must prophesy."
* The prophet Daniel saw a vision of a "son of man" coming with the clouds, which is a reference to the coming Messiah.
* Jesus also said that the Son of Man will be coming back someday on the clouds.
* These references to the Son of Man coming on the clouds reveal that Jesus the Messiah is God.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* When Jesus uses the term "Son of Man" it could be translated as "the One who became a human being" or "the Man from heaven."
* Some translators occasionally include "I" or "me" with this title (as in "I, the Son of Man") to make it clear that Jesus was talking about himself.
* Check to make sure that the translation of this term does not give a wrong meaning (such as referring to an illegitimate son or giving the wrong impression that Jesus was only a human being).
* When used to refer to a person, "son of man" could also be translated as "you, a human being" or "you, man" or "human being" or "man."
