Jesus continues telling the parable about the servants and the talents. (See:  and )

# You reap where you did not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter
The words "reap where you did not sow" and "harvest where you did not scatter" mean the same thing. They refer to a farmer who gathers crops that other people have planted. The servant uses this metaphor to accuse the master of taking what rightfully belongs to others. (See:  and )

# scatter
scatter seed. This refers to sowing seed by gently throwing handfuls of it onto the soil.
