Jesus continues telling a parable. (See: )

# Again he went out
Again the landowner went out

# the sixth hour and again the ninth hour
The sixth hour is around noon. The ninth hour is around three in the afternoon. (See: )

# did the same
This means the landowner went to the marketplace and hired workers.
