# Connecting Statement:
Jesus continues to respond to the Pharisees.

# I say to you
This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# say to you
Here "you" is plural. Jesus is speaking directly to the Pharisees, but he is also teaching the crowd. (See: )

# every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will forgive every sin that people commit and every evil thing they say" or "God will forgive every person who sins or says evil things" (See: )

# blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will not forgive the person who speaks evil things about the Holy Spirit" (See: )
