Jesus concludes his proverb of a master and servants to illustrate that his disciples should be prepared for his return. (See: )

# says in his heart
Here "heart" refers to the mind. Alternate translation: "thinks in his mind" (See: )

# My master has been delayed
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "My master is slow to return" or "My master will not return for a long time" (See: )
