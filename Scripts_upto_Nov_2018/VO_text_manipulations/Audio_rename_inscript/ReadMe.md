# The renaming is done in ( 2 letter book standard name + chapter number ) example "LK1.mp3" for Luke 1.

# Script containing folder should have the input folder with the name language & version (Hin_IRV).

# The generated folder will have the folder name of input folder name with extention of (_audio) i.e.(Hin_IRV_audio)._

# The Bible book folder should have proper numbering.

# Make sure, you don't have any other folder with this name pattern.

# Check the sample file.

# To run this scipt :
	1. create a folder and Paste the script, and add input folder.
	2. Edit the script as you need.
	3. Run the script (python3 rename_mp3_inscript.py).
	4. The script will rename the mp3 files inside the book folder.
	5. Then a new folder is being generated and those renamed mp3 files will be moved here.
	6. Therefore the mp3 files won't exists in old folder folder.
